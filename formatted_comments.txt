### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
What a great lecturer! Everything is explaind so detailed, preciselly and clear. Now i understand why education in UK is US$12k and in US is US$60k. It is 5 times better then I achived in a 12 weak course in my Uni
Thank you!

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Ok now we understand x axis when plotting against y axis is actually looking at an object from the top..
If we add the z axis we can understand that object little bit more

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I wish I had the privilege to attend to one of his classes in person. You, professor, are a very enlightened person. All I can say is thank you for your devotion to quality education.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]Use Euler’s formula with x =6t:

e^ix = cos x + i sin x

|e^ix| = |cos x + i sin x|
         = sqrt((cos x + i sin x)(cos x – i sin x))
         = sqrt(cos^2 x + sin^2 x)
         = sqrt(1)
         = 1

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Omg the orthogonality between nullspace and row space adds up so well with the v=[1,2,3] example prof. gave previous lecture. I've seen much less entertaining tv series than 18.06, this course should be on Netflix lol

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
What is the reason for wearing a baseball cap backwards?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy screwed up at 26:27 by by using d(e^w)/dw = e^w, which is the exact conclusion he needs to prove. He should've calculated derivative of ln(x) using definition of derivative. Then he can find derivative of e^x using inverse function derivative property. Can't believe this is MIT.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
48:50 I had to look up why that is a right angle. It wasn't so obvious to me. But great lecture!

I didn't get the 'mathemagic' transformation of \frac{\epsilon}{n} into \epsilon. I will be glad if someone provides an explanation or a reference to it.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I paused the video when he wrote pi/2 and solved the integral many times getting pi/8 😢, thinking I was wrong

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dang, this professor does every portion of the problem so quick that it would take me a little while to do each portion.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ok ive watched this video till the 16 min, and i jus gotta stop there, why? Cuz uptill now i tried to follow wat hes saying, then he wrote that important formula, I got lost. Deep.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I have an exam in like.. 5 hours and am exhausted, yet, as soon as I heard the joke about Clinton and Monica, I spat out my morning coffee and laughed so hard my entire dorm woke up. Thank you so much for not only teaching me everything I need to know, but also making it fun and making it stick!

God knows..." 

LOL!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wouldn't the derivative of the magnitude of the position vector 14:57 tell you the speed with respect to the origin?

The magnitude of the position vector is the distance between the position and the origin.  The derivative tells you if the magnitude is getting larger or smaller, but that's the same as saying the distance to the origin is getting larger or smaller.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
My main man Gilbert "strong" Strang is a BOSS!!! Thank you so much for the lecture!!!

### 23. Probabilistic Computation, BPP
What's the fullname of BPP?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is a gold mind! [sic]

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Why cant all professors teach that good? Why did we need to suffer until this lecture?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent way of transfer of knowledge. Explaining difficult concept in the most easy and understandable way. 👍

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
cliffhanger!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I tried to reach same conclusion using the fact that p is perpendicular to (b-p) i.e. p(t) * (b-p) = 0 and then substitute p=Ax but failed to get similar result as @28:31. There is an x(t) hanging around.
-> p(t) *(b-p) = 0
-> (Ax)(t) * (b-Ax)=0
-> x(t) * A(t) * (b-Ax)=0
-> x(t) *  [ A(t) * b - A(t) * A * x ] = 0

--?? can I justify that the second term must equate to zero?

any suggestions how to move forward? 

where " "(t) is  " " transpose.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
23 is key time .

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I can feel professor Jerison progressively becoming more and more annoyed with that kid with all the questions.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If anyone is struggling with this lecture, Wikipedia does a wonderful job of explaining the second derivative test intuitively: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_partial_derivative_test#Geometric_interpretation_in_the_two-variable_case

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Simply genius Who said algebra  is difficult.

### 14. Poisson Process I

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Not very different from the profs we have... :)

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Me too…it in our DNATGC

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
I have a question about the bias and variance of the estimator theta_hat = X_1 metioned at time : 11m00s.
- Why isn't the bias = (X_1 - theta)^2 ? Because bias = (E[X_1] -theta)^2 = (X_1 - theta)^2.
- Why is the variance  = 0? Because variance = E[(X_1 - E[X_1])^2] = E[(X_1 - X_1)^2] = 0.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone Tell  me why @=T. ????

### 34. Final Course Review
Great lectures! It's been blessed to take prof Strang's class online.

### 24. Classical Inference II
At 22:04, shouldn't it be 'E[XY]=theta0*E[X]+theta1E[X^2] -> E[XY]=(E[Y]-theta1*E[X])*E[X]+theta1E[X^2] -> E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]=theta1(E[X^2]-E[X]^2)'?

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if u think the lectures are very easy, then good! go download the problem sets then you will actually learn something. :)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is great!!!!!!


### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I thought for like 5 mins. on your sentence, and then eventually figured out that it was so non-mathematical! lolzz

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
MIT 이래서... 최고의 인재들이 태어나는 군요.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yes ok, but I'm sorry. Didn't want to offend you, I just wondering..

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
When he is looking up at the board above @17:17, and I'm scrolling the mouse to see it...... 2005 problem became 2017 problem.... doh! I troll myself. :(

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MITOPENCOURSEWARE:  US taxes and US citizen donations used to educate US economic competition world-wide.  Question:  WHY ?  Answer:  That is what the dominating public-private partnerships have decreed upon the American people:  (a) Our eaten flesh, and (b) Americans forcibly averaged into globalism.  To MIT:  Why have you gone along with such an agenda assuming you are still "pro-America" ?

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
The most important concept and ---the camera man decided not to focus correctly!!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
his passion to teach is one of the most beatiful things i have seen it ! wow .. he looks like feymann i mean his way of teach us

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"ZERRO"...funny accent.


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I disagree with the statement at 9:13 and 11:13. Should it not be combinations of columns of B or combinations of rows of A? Cj = A * Bj where Bj is the jth column of B. Similarly for rows, it's Ci.T = Ai.T * B where Ai.T is the ith row of A.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Spectacular teaching !!!! 

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
oh and by the way, that intro starts to piss me off after watching so many lectures !

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Prof. Gilbert Strang was born on November 27, 1934. He wants to teach when he is 100. All the best!!!

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
a lot of mistakes this guy makes.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Having seen the lectures, I don't have much of a problem in the lectures, but then going onto MIT's site, I see the problemset, and I be like:


"HOW THE F*** DO PEOPLE DO THESE PROBLEMS???"

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thank you so much OCW & Dr. Rodriguez for putting video lectures to these notes! Since last year's 18.102 notes were published to the website, they have been the most valuable and easily-approachable resource for me when learning functional analysis.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
I am happy to see this person alive in 2019. May God gave him a long life

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
THIS PROFEESOR OF MATHEMATICS IS NICE

I WANT TO GIVE HIM TIPS BEING A STUDENT

PLEASE SIR ALWAYS ATTEMPT THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH YOU SOLVE ON BLACK BOARD

OTHERWISE DON'T ATTEMPT

I LIKED YOUR WAY OF TEACHING BUT YOU WILL GET SOME TIME TO BE PROFESSOR WALTER LEWIN

HE WAS LEGEND

YOU SHOULD SEE HIS LECTURES TO TEACH STUDENTS AS AN EXAMPLE

I LOVE TO BE AN AUSTRONAUT TO WATCH YOUR PROGRAMMES

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Where I stopped. 0:00 Dec 26

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is  the professor's name ?

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Wonderful Explanation!

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Actually as you seen in the lecture curl is defined as the cross product between the del operator and the vector field.The problem here is that the cross product is defined only in 3D(and 7D ),so I am also wondering how curl generalizes to higher dimension other than 7D

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I Really Like The Video Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane From Your

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
a frenchman, giving an example based upon frog legs? how absurd.

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
So can a field only be an ordered field if it is {0} or has no upper bound - I don't mean does not have the least upper bound property, just no upper bound?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
best explain i have seen yet !!!!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
What the hell u have complied this shitty book

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I always thought that the use of matrices (with the defined mathematical operations - especially the ability to find inverses -) should have facilitated the automation of solving systems of equations. Wouldn't that be a fun computer program to write? But (and correct me if I am wrong), this turns out to be a blunt instrument  involving far more calculations than necessary. So computers follow the "simplex" method. This does sort out the "linear independence"  problem as you go along. And I concede that this method is actually more suitable for automation.   I look forward to seeing how Dr Strang handles this dilemma.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor just had a haircut

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
's' should be displacement, but that's a very minute correction

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
In all this time. this is by far the best explanation of least squares I've ever seen. Honestly thank you very much for the video.

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do you know better? :D

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
He said "toin coss" twice at 25:10. :D

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
The closing statement is to die for 😁 thanks for the amazing lecture.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is not that Greek minds are behind. There are everywhere clever and stupid people.
BTW great lectures!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Awesome lecture. Neat and consistent. The stability part is much better than what i have learned in linear system class.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
If he could interject comic relief every now and then he'd be phenomenal.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
항상성과 매개변수가 같다면 오진법과 십진법에서 7로 잡아서 문제를 풀고 대비숫자를 기준으로 문제를 도출해서 문제를 풀면된다. 의사결정 지원 시스템에 문제를 기입하고 풀면 됩니다.

### 13. Bernoulli Process

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
is it my computer or is the sound level a bit low?

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
Fantastic lecture. Many thanks for this.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Jor jor se bolke logo ko scheme bata de

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
42:16 For some cuts of s1, it cannot be pumped I think (there is even/odd fashion there, but it's proof by contradiction, so one example should be enough). Let's say p is odd, then we cut <vxy> where x="1" and (v, y) has same number of "0"s in that case it can be pumped, but what if p is even ? then x="1" and we are left with (p-1) which clearly cuts in unequal parts for v and y, so the number of zeros in one side (whichever) will be smaller than other side. As I mentioned earlier, since we are proving by contradiction, one example should be sufficient to show the contradiction. Any thoughts, why this wouldn't work ?

Edit: I got it wrong at first glance, the answer to my statement above is: You need to show there is NO way to cut the string such that it can be pumped.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm actually confused how easily amused the crowd was lol

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Genius teaching, every math student has to find a professor like him, in every domain of maths

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
i love statistics exam, after calculating, i dk what did i calculate, but i still calculated stuff😂

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Can someone please explain the significance of the answer to his last question at 47:13 ?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:20 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Not a fan of him proving the diffusion equation. I will use Chain Rule.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
is that the best chalk?

### 4. Counting
Since I always hated it when sth is defined "just so that it works" or seemingly arbitrary..

The way I explain 0! = 1:
3! divided by 3 = 2!
2! divided by 2 = 1!
1! divided by 1 = 0! 

Same goes for x to the power of 0

Anyways the prof in this video explains things 100* better than my profs.. They just confuse me all the time and their slides look very complicated. Even these easy counting rules, that have been explained at high school pretty well..Luckily I found these videos on youtube

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I am pretty sure that if I had been fortunate to attend his class, I would have gotten more interest in math and could be a better scientist.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Notes: 1. For Ax=b, we can draw a picture that projection vector p plus e is equal to b. To solve linear regression problems we can calculate the A'Ax=A'b firstly. Then p=Ax, e=b-p.
2. If A has independent columns then A'A is invertible.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
：）


### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
This lecture was beautiful... The way everything connects and binds together is stunning... Invaluable knowledge! Thanks mr. Strang

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Professor Strang lays out the concept of vector spaces in almost tedious detail.  The result:  I finally confidently understand vector spaces at a very basic conceptual level and I'm already beginning to extrapolate for myself.  I imagine that this firm foundation will make the next few lectures that much easier and that much more rewarding.  Thank you Professor Strang and thank you MIT.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Yes!!

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Amazing

### 18. Properties of Determinants
He is really good...thx for uploading this

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Thanks!!!! Very helpful.


### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Im using this lecture series as a supplemental study aid for my multivariable calculus class right now and couldn't  help but talk myself through all the math on my midterm in a heavy french accent. All kidding aside, its incredible how even though this professor is teaching the brightest minds, he explains everything so clearly and logically that anyone could learn a ton from this course. MIT, i think its incredible that you guys post these lectures, your professors have an incredible way of communicating information and I think its extremely noble of you guys to make that accessible to anyone with access to a computer.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Math in the USA is really not difficult compared to what happens to African Nations.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Which book does this class use?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
So underestimated approaches have been revield through column space matters more then rows space.
So genius.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
x = x1, x2, x3, x4 are like potentials V1, V2, V3, V4 at each node

Ax = 0 gives potential differences (voltages) V2-V1 etc. 

I = V/R (Ohm's law) gives currents I1 to I5 (y1 to y5) at each node
(he uses C to denote R^(-1) matrix)

(A^T)y = 0, which is Kirchhoff's current law

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
At 1:11:30 why does he use the biased sample variance and not the unbiased one? Conceptually it doesn't matter?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
35:20 Being an orthogonal matrix does not mean that it is square.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Its amazing how the previous recitation perfectly syncs with the lecture at 16:17

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
glad i found the MIT videos
from india

### 18. Properties of Determinants
seems that i have been in this classroom before, for some information theory course.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
22:52 so yağğğğğhhh y'know

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Takes me back to my student days to experience that brilliance of the art of Mathematics! The way teaching was meant to be. The difference now being the "enjoyable aspect" of Professor Strang's obvious devotion to the subject. Brilliantly presented lectures on often abstruse aspects, with an inbuilt system of "creativity and innovation" for students. Surely remarkable.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
should have gone to MIT...(sigh)


### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I like the way of writing "of". It seems like sign of the zodiac

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
37:28 lol

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does he talk about the dropping the watermelon example in this video?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
The person handling the cameras should be tracking the content pointed by the lecturer and not tracking the lecturer.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Can it be applied in economics

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This course is a mine of gold

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
co factors is how you normally find the determinant....

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
All of these are taught to students of India at high school level XII standard in Science stream, at much deeper level specially to students preparing for admissions in IITs.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]My 10th grade math teacher took 2 months to explain what this guy explained in like 40 mins :/

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
diffrentiate sec in a sec!!!

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:53 These are questions that should be asked in recitation, not in lecture.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
what is meant by a combination?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Since San Francisco is relatively hilly, the elevation of a home may be a good way to distinguish the two cities.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
These lectures are so old (but they are truly gold)
I guess some of the students back there have become professors themselves

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1/x{f(1/μ)}/Y·{0}BINARY CODE OF PROBABILITY: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVGVQ_r7lIfkbG2206E5boPDZW8erbdjW
Solve for h. When h'/μ of cartesian (x'y'z') with quantum binary being {0}

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is awesome! When I did linear algebra, my prof taught us the simplest, most straightforward way to do things (bless his heart): this guy is teaching much more complicated ways, but the thinking is crystal clear.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks for this great lecture, MIT and the OCW team!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I'm confused at around 17:25, detA*I shouldn't be detA^n*I? cause it is the matrix of detA,so each row can be divided over detA, so that is detA^n*I!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
That lecture has been recorded few years ago, but my teacher still sucks in that moment -_-

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It's a bit depressing as to how badly the education system has failed you.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wouldn't have built this mentality that I'll never be able to get even average at maths if we had teachers like this 🙏🙏🙏

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
simply amazing!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Denis Auroux

### 14. Poisson Process I
I dont get the bit @ 15:50 about small interval probabilities being a limiting case. Why are there any second order terms?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This man has managed to teach me more in 2 lectures than my linear algebra professor has been able to teach me in 6. Seriously, these are saving my grade

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME](First of all, I don´t speak english as a native language, so, sorry for my mistakes) I think that is kinda stupid to criticize these videos that are free, I mean, if Somebody were paying it would be ok to give "not flattering" comments...

There is a expression in my country "A caballo regalado, no le mires el diente" (Never look a gift horse in the mouth)

This is free men/woman...don´t worry, I know you are just making a observation and not criticizing

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
If i ever do graduate, it’ll be 100% thanks to this guy.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks sir

Improve Your Life In Many Ways Today 🎉

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
What a nice explaining! Before watching this lecture, I just memorized expectation and variance of binomial distribution. Now I definitely understood them. Thank you professor!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have extreme autism which makes me able to hold more information than 99.9% of the population, I did calculus at 7 years old. Normal people like you are mere insects to me, very simple and easy to manipulate. 

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am expecting something more serious other than this kind of "informal " proof

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is lec 17

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
So good to be back do decent quality after Lecture 4!

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
53:38 H is positive definite when we are testing for a minimum. But for convex, if we only need d2f/dx2>=0, then I only need 2 diagonal entries if H be positive. No requirement for fxx and fyy.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how he got 1/delta X  at 20.16 and how he canceled while applying limit

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
Excellent lecture, horrible recording. Hardly hear anything with max volume and why the camera has to shoot at the prof speaking rather than staying on the slides? It is very distracting and hard to follow.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Thank you very much for the clear  explanation of eigenvalue and singular value computation process. 
btw, I'm happy to be the first person who give a comment on this  brilliant lecture :D

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
@31:00"The proper word, of course, is parallelepiped.  But for obvious reasons, uh..., I wrote box."  rofl!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Why is it that for R^n n vectors give a basis if the n by n matrix with those columns is invertible?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
how do we estimate the percentage of error in the observations while making the projection approximation?

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well they want to be sure everyone knows the basics of it. Not everyone go to school in USA or Britain . For example, my school in Croatia did not even mention  matrices, mean, median and mode which are the basic things in US school system.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
The Mister Rogers of Linear Algebra. (The soothing tone, the rhetorical questioning)

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the name of this teacher? He is A MA ZING ! jijijiji

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
1:13:51 v1 ZULUL

### 13. Regression
❤️

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Teaching norms with their R2 pictures is just brilliant. So much insight, even emerging while teaching (sparsity of L1 optimum: it's on the axis!!). An absolute joy to watch & learn from

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT. #Grateful.

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
Saddle point means geodesic ? All about the second derivatives seems to be conversed to this story, covariant derivative, Christoffel symbol, and second fundamental form.

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
25:16 is a bit weird to me. If mu2 surpasses lambda1, both mu2 and mu1 would be larger than lambda1 then, the interlacing wouldn't hold anymore. Anyone understands what's going on?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in fact when you diferenciate 1/v in relation to v, you are using a quotient rule and cant use that to prove itself

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Really sir want to thank for your great job.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:06 is not a function. Function is a relation in which there is a unique image of every element in the domain.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Understanding the meaning of legendary in these series of videos

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
A legend of linear algebra

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Matrix still exsist right here right now 2022 🤦‍♂️😂

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Look at those chumps walking in late...

### 2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem
To be honest, it is not a clear lecture. Maybe MIT students are smart enough to learn totally

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
So how many families are there with more than just 2 repeated roots?  The example of 4 repeated roots showed 2 different Jordan decompositions, one with a size 3 and size 1 jordan block, and then another with two size 2 jordan blocks.  They are not similar.  What's the partition law for the number of families of similar matrices with d repeated roots?  Is there a connection with group theory?  How about multiple groups of repeated roots?   for 2x2 matrices, there's 2 cases: unique and single family of similar matrices, or single repeated eigenvalue and 2 families, the scaled identity, and the remaining family similar to the jordan form.  How many families for 3x3, 4x4, etc matrices?  curious...

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I knew Strang would use square brackets. Parentheses for matrices suck!

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do we also need to take absolute value of x at 48:22?

### Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem
Most of the space is wasted and the audio is not great either. It should zoom in his hand when he writes on the board.  The zoom should should be so that  the frame differencing is a maximum.  This way the focus is exclusively on the professor.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I want to write on that chalkboard with that chalk.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Maybe it's just the subject but this guy explains so much better than Professor Jerison

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i watch all the lectures at 1.25x but not this guy. he is fast.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you can't get into MIT, go to a state university. The education is the same and cheaper and in today's crummy job market, you're lucky if you get a job even with an MIT degree.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
sounds french. plus his last name is Auroux

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think he got lost in this lesson, he should have use the propiertes of ln and make the equation lny=lna^x and then use the chain rule and implicit diferentiation and he would have finish right away

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
The first video was recorded in Fall 2017. The rest of the lectures were recorded in Fall 2016, but video of Lecture 1 was not available. Only me notice this?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Somebody is coughing heavily . Please make a covid-19 test immediately 😂😂😂

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
The efforts Prof. Strang puts in at this age is in itself an inspiration for all of us.
Thank You!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am really thankful to have this video, however, I do have one small criticism of the cinematography.  The camera zooms in and holds on old information for too long. I'm halfway through the video and this has happened several times. It's a small complaint, and really we are all lucky to be able to watch this for free, but this video is not as convenient to watch as other OCW vids due to this zoom and hold method of shooting the camera person utilized. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
How advanced is this math? I know it's not real hard, but relative to other math classes at MIT, how hard is this one?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You're a great lecturer sir thanks for everything 🙏

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Prof. Strang can get it. no homo

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Seriously, this guy is why reading the edited, vetted course book is superior to the lecture.  If you were truly a neophyte you'd be lost by so many of the skipped steps and failed contextual references. This lecture is targeted at grad students who want too feel nostalgic.

### 24. Classical Inference II
Who is responsible for the audio volume fluctuations?
GAH!
This video is almost unwatchable.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
The curious room observationally curl because tabletop jointly visit despite a utter coast. longing, ill-informed oak

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
How did he replace x in x.P(x) by "a" for all x >= a?
Can somebody please explain?

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Second derivative test boundaries and infinity.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I really don't know why would I pay thousands of dollars just to get a course that is not close to 1/100 of this just because it is " for credit." I have been watching his videos and using a textbook with a manual solution as a mean of self-learning. I learn more than what I got in class. Then I can spend my thousands of dollars to have a vacation or at least survive my life for years.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
30:00, the way to remember it is that the work is a straightforward dot product of F with <dx, dy>, M goes with x and N goes with y and we add, and the flux is a dot product of F with the same vector rotated pi/2 so N goes with x and a minus sign with few choices left for M. Auroux missed a nice opportunity at the beginning to clarify the sign convention for flux by foreshadowing the result for closed curves with + being from the inside, out. I'm not faulting anyone, I couldn't give a lecture on this and keep possession of both my hands when erasing blackboards operated by hazardous machines. If he loses his hands, he'll never erase anything again. Be careful out there, Denis, we don't want to lose a great teacher.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
22:36 : positive semidefinite, not positive definite

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I like how he explained how a matrix multiplied by a matrix works. I never thought of it as: each row of the matrices say how many rows of the other matrix you want to make the final matrix.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
13 :54 
angle along vertical axis should be  sin theta than why did he use cos theta?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Great lecture ! 

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Somethings are so beautiful when comprehended a certain way. 
Prof. Strang's lecture are as much about the art of transfering such beautiful comprehension one might have experienced as it is about Linear Algebra.
Many in youtube have the skill of making a difficult things easy to grasp. But what you also get from Prof. Strang is that sense of euphoria that comprehension of something beautiful invokes.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Yeah you're right, basically first year at Uni is a lot easier than A levels. Second year is a rude awakening, you work your ass off. Of course all the genius' posting here were discovering dark energy in their freshman year (or you would think that was the case the way they act so patronising and smug about this lecture.) It hasn't dawned on them that MIT have some experience in educating some of the brightest minds and recapping first principles might just have a valid purpose

### 4. Factorization into A = LU

Thank you very much, Professor, for such a beautiful explanation of the subject

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
A true legend in computational science and engineerng education.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When he says "What is this good for?" I want to say "Absolutely NOTHING!"

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
HELP! I think Strang might have got WRONG around 05:40. I think P U L is a SUBSPACE of P as P & L itself is a subspace of P.

Think like this: let p & l be a vector from P & L respectively. than u=p+l belongs to
P U L and u lies within P as p is within P and l is also within P.

Also c*p & c*l belongs to P & L respectively where c is scalar as P&L are subspace. so c*u=(c*p + c*l) belongs to P U L. 

Finally, zero vector lies in both P & L. so Zero vectors belongs to P U L.
So P U L is subspace.


### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
20:30 Where is the dx comes from? from d(u*v)/dx=u*dv/dx+v*du/dx get d(u*v)=u*dv+v*du, the integrate both side, ∫1d(u*v)=∫u*dv+∫v*du, finally we get u*v=∫u*dv+∫v*du

Dont understand physic, he messed up everything; took 10 mins to explain simple problem; Listen Prof. Ramamurti Shankar from Yale university.
Subjectb choosen excellent but lecturer has troubles to talk fluently and clearly; he stops every other secs. I think Yale is much much better.

Are a1 and a1 perpendicular to e OR
a1 and a2 perpendicular to the plane?

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Funny how previously the students have shuddered at the mere mention of Taylor series, or putting a 2x2 linear system in matrix form, but when partial differential equations are mentioned they don't bat an eyelid. Based on their previous responses, I would've expected to hear violent screams followed swiftly by a mass exodus from the classroom :)

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Isn't this just talking about bias variance tradeoff where we are minimizing frobenius norm + bias is zero since estimator is unbiased? Also the reason why variance is number is that we are minimizing variance of frobenius norm. 
What I understood is this

uh, I misunderstood. After seeing the justification from Taylor expansion or quadratic approximation, I understand better why Prof. Auroux spent so much time on exploring the quadratic function earlier. This is a relatively harder topic, as reflected by those "dislikes". Thanks for the lecture. 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Fantastic video. Love this guy.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks Prof. Excellent

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you Denis, you're a brilliant lecturer.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is lecture 1 in 2009 

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:35....very odd.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why did he chose specifically a square bottomed box??

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This guy is a genius ...... No doubt about that ..................... :)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Where can i download the homework excersices?

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
is this how the conditional pmf at 16:39 is computed?

X<=2 && Y>=3

P{Y=3}=(2/20)+(4/20)=6/20   
P{Y=4}=(1/20)+(2/20)=3/20   
P{Y>=3}=P{Y=3}+P{Y=4}=6/20+3/20=9/20

P{X=1}=(1/20)+(2/20)=3/20
P{X=2}=(2/20)+(4/20)=6/20
P{X<=2}=P{X=1}+P{X=2}=3/20+6/20=9/20

P{X=1|Y>=3}
=P{X=1,Y>=3}/P{Y>=3}=P{X=1,Y=3}/P{Y>=3} + P{X=1,Y=4}/P{Y>=3}
=[(2/20)+(1/20)]/[(6/20)+(3/20)]
=(2/20)/(9/20) + (1/20)/(9/20)
=2/9 + 1/9 
=3/9

P{X=2|Y>=3}
=P{X=2,Y>=3}/P{Y>=3}=(P{X=2,Y=3}+P{X=2,Y=4})/P{Y>=3}
=[(4/20)+(2/20)]/[(6/20)+(3/20)]
=4/9 + 2/9 
=6/9

P{Y=3|X<=2}
=P{Y=3,X<=2}/P{X<=2}=(P{Y=3,X=1}+P{Y=3,X=2})/P{X<=2}
=[(2/20)+(4/20)]/[9/20]
= 2/9 +4/9 
=6/9

P{Y=4|X<=2}
=P{Y=4,X<=2}/P{X<=2}=(P{Y=4,X=1}+P{Y=4,X=2})/P{X<=2}

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I should be studying taxation, what I am doing here🙄🤔

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
第一次知道三位直线参数方程是怎么来的

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hope to meet him in MIT. I need to work Hard

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You cannot assume that 

"1 = .9999999999999999999999999"

because that is clearly false.

1 = .9999999999999.... infinitely repeating. 

"then why does: 1/3 = .333333333333333333333"

It doesn't. See above.

"3*(1/3) = .9999999999999999999999999999"

Wrong.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
https://crowdfund.mit.edu/project/2286

If you're watching this video then you know how beneficial MIT OCW is! Donate now! It literally took a minute and was so easy and I'm not someone who can be bothered donating to things normally..

But if like me you've ever had trouble learning something at school/uni or needed extra material or just been keen to learn then you may have benefited from all the great lectures + content MIT OCW provides! So give back a little even if it's just a few dollars and share and convince others to give too. :)

If we want humanity to progress then education is key and it's great to see one of the best universities in the world putting up it's resources to benefit everyone! 

Let's keep on learning and growing and making this world a better place as a result :)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Can someone explain "Take one of this one and none of that one" at 40:56?  It looks like he's talking about a "selector" type version of using 0 and 1's .
Thanks.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Please fix the audio...

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions

I promise not to write another thing, but I can erase you know... lmao

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know it's great the job but to "help" with the open lessons it supposed one should give some economic support but what is the cost to start recording a video and then upload it? u just push record and that's all. Any way it's a great job but if u wanna really get value u have to "impose" your value so other case few people will consider that it has any value with its totally wrong

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
i should jus tranfer to MIT...like right now...

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Sir which book you have preferred for this

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
So great to see prof Strang here on Youtube in 2020!! What fond memories.  I took Applied Math from prof. Strang back in 1995 or 1996 at M.I.T.  The math department (course 18) was filled with brilliant people who had no ability to communicate or teach, except prof. Strang and maybe one or two others.  Not only was he a brilliant teacher, but it was so liberating to realize that really hard math became easy when taught well, and that  perhaps I was not an idiot when I was having a hard time understanding when taught poorly.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I indexed this video on MyVindex for quick video referencing between the geometric, analytical interpretations and examples.  - http://www.myvindex.co/app.html#/home/iSKiXlzQ  .  Email me if you're interested in MyVindex at jmoseman01@gmail.com

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This comment section sure has a lot of egos. Math brainiacs feeling the need to show off their mad skillz: humility might do you some good. It's fantastic that this stuff is incredibly easy for you - it isn't for everyone, and proclaiming your genius to the world serves no one, it only comes off as arrogant.

If this is below your level - great, go to some higher level videos. In the meantime, show some respect for MIT and appreciation for their work in making good education open to everyone, and some consideration for your fellow students who may have more trouble with this stuff.

### 13. Regression
What's up with the dirty blackboard?

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
I wish u were my professo Mr Strang, 
but hey, I have u as my Professor here online:
thank you very much for ur elegant  explanation.
Wish u good healt and long live Mr Strang

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
Fantastic lecture... i am so lucky to watch and learn.... i am an ordinary mother of two little girls and recently finding myself experiencing full of joy learning linear algebra. It is all happened to me beacuse of wonderful lecturer and mit. thank you for sharing with us. I am going to continue to learn. Many thanks from korea.

"Some of them know more than me," wow...if only all professors were like this, once failed a unit cause I used knowledge the lec didn't teach💔

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
David is amazing - well done MIT

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Good!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
thank you so much because I was lost and my midterm is tomorrow. I very much needed this

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
If the latter, that's the bossest prof I've ever seen.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
One easy way to understand matrix multiplication using Machine Learning Classification strategy: 1. Rows of C are combinations of rows of B: just treat it as classification with one example but mutiple classifiers; 2. Columns of C are combinations of columns of A: just treat it as classification with multiple examples but only one classifier; 3. sumOf(Columns of A * Rows of B): jut treat it as classification with multiple examples and mutiple classifiers but should be added up with all features in data examples.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why we need approximation here, i see we can calculate exactly sin x and cosine x.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
For a person who is not really good at math, I hope this will really help me to develop a big picture of what linear algebra is. Thanks Prof. Strang.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:38 My fellow Imgurians, this is what you're looking for.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Whatever he said here just blows your mind.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Anyone know where I can find some practice assignments? Or is there only the textbook? Thanks.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
7:40 Nodes 1,2, and 3 form a loop? It seems strange since the direction of the edge connecting nodes 1 and 3. At least from my usual use of the word "loop" it doesn't seem like a loop since if you leave node 1 you can't get back to node 1. Comments anyone?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didnt know kermit used to be a math teacher.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I've watched Prof Strang before  my exams....

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
In that Hat problem, why is P(X_i = 1) = 1/n?
Shouldn't it depend on the value of i. What I mean is for the first person it is 1/n but for the second it is 1/n-1 if the first one did not get his hat and 0 if the first one picked his hat.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is this on the front page?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
His linear algebra books are pure garbage. They are not at all recommended for those who want a deep insight into abstract algebra. All he does is provide a very computational approach towards learning linear algebra, which I think is very unfortunate.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Hats off to you man

### 18. Properties of Determinants
These videos are amazing for test review. My linear algebra teacher is awesome but these videos are nice to watch since hopefully I already know everything going on.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much, Professor Strang, and MIT.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I took linear algebra in fall 2014, is it weird that I'm rewatching this now for fun?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The derivative is not just the slope of a line. A function can be non-linear or may have 2 lines which are discontinuous... Refer to lecture 1.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lecture.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
he skips so many stuffs.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Better name's for dot is scalar, and for cross is vector product.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he gave both forms of the spelling at 0:50

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The binomial theorem can be applied to any real or complex exponent, so the limit power rule proof holds for any exponent

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you enjoy Khan, you might also like a channel called PatrickJMT; although, you probably know him already.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I have so much respect for professor Gilbert Strang. He's at such an advanced age in these videos yet he can still give such great lectures. In fact it's 2018 and he still is giving lectures!

### Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
cool

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
Sorry I'm having trouble keeping up, but for the Poisson example, where does that expression for mu(x) come from?


This is terrific by the way- thank you MIT for helping me stay even a little afloat in one of my classes.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Great lecture, thanks a lot ! Just a little question : at 41:00, isn't the saddle point supposed to be a minimum for x in its row and a maximum for y in its column ? Or maybe the opposite works too ? But if there were 2 saddle points in a matrix, then they would be equal... I'm a little confused.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
haha i love this guy, 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Was a very good video.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree if we were talking about a community college, but I'm just guessing the caliber of student that gets accepted to MIT probably already knows a good amount about basic calculus such as this.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
@[USERNAME]OpenCourseWare
Can you please tell me the difference between this course and the  on in this link: https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/index.htm

They look similar to me in content. The one in the link looks more structured.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where is lecture 34? That's the 4th one missing :-o

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This professor is so wonderful! He presents each new bit of information in such a way that makes it seem intuitive to me and I just love listening to him lecture! 

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Actually, if a constant k=1/1m is used, then in the final formula for V you will end up with subtracting m^1 from m^2 which is apparently not correct.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
n! = n(n-1)(n-2) .... (n-(n-1))

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I'm curious. What was the last guy's doubt?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sad to see the university level kids don't know how to compute  determinants.
in Pakistan, even the 6th grade kids know this ...!!haha

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
maybe it's because they have to pay their professors so much? And they would probably use the money to fund more in internet education because money is allocated to specific parts within MIT.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't think it's arrogant to assume that if you're studying calculus, you should know that -3 is larger than -4.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
My heart skipped a beat at 12:02...

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I cant understand why is the du/dt not in the equation (which is at 36:54) even with the explanation that provided on the comment lol

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Did he miss the explanation why u is eigenvector of A^t A after proving the u's are orthogonal?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"Maybe I'll leave the author to prove that..." 

He is the author of the textbook they are using though! Hah!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
@[USERNAME]
1/2(1 + sqrt(5)) is also the golden ratio!  Math is amazing =]  I'm sure the professor knew the answer and didn't calculate it in his head on the spot.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good luck!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm sorry but in my opinion for any freshman at MIT, this stuff should have been covered in high school.   I mean, this is MIT after all.   Anyone agree with me?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
how about calling it an egg...


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Respect full thank you 🙏.
Love you so much sir...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The proof at the end starts off with: f(x) x->a = f(a) - the definition of continuous. So f(x) x->a - f(a)=0. 

Then simplifies to f'(a)*0, this however only holds if a function is continuous. If a function was not continuous then it would simplify to f'(a)*some constant. As f(x) x->a - f(a)=c - is not continuous.

Which would make it not = 0. 

And in order to be differentiable x-a has to go to zero (by definition). That is how differentiable implies continuous.

I hope this helps.

### 34. Final Course Review
I had up and downs throughout the course, but never less, this is the best course I had so far. 
Thank you Prof. Gilbert Strang for your teaching and thanks MIT for sharing these astonishing lectures for free!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
May I say that the vectors in R span the same space as vectors in A after row operation because you can do a reverse ROW operation and construct the same vectors in A from R? It can't be true for column space because after row operations you most likely can't reverse and reconstruct the original column vectors from R through COLUMN combinations.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i have another idea for the proof of sin(x)/x=1 as x tends to 0
imagine the graph of sin(x)
as x tends to 0 the slope approaches 1 (f'(sin(x))=cos(x) and cos(0)=1). This would mean that x is the x value and sinx is the y. Since the slope approaches 1 then this means that the rise over the run (y/x)=1 or sinx/x=1

### Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series
I feel immensely happy every day when I watch  Dr. Casey Rodriguez's lecture

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MATHGASM!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I love how you can actually see his brain thinking lol 

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
The bijection between subspace of row space and subspace of col space had been hinted quite nicely in previous lectures and in the textbook by Dr. Strang, e.g. he stressed the fact there lies an identity when we do row reduction. So nice that I figured this out when I walk through the previous materials. But still, he managed to show there's a new (to me) point of view to such bijection: pseudo-inverse works as *the* inverse function of the bijection mapping, and that the pseudo-inverse *also eliminates* some (resp. left) null space, just like what the original is doing. Such symmetry, such beauty.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I took stats last year, it was tough! Luckily my school used Lumen which helped a lot! It had practice problems  so you can know what you do wrong, so u can go back and work on it before going on to your official home work. I was able to get an A but it was tough and had to put a lot of extra time aside dedicated just to my homework etc because i am very very bad at math. The lumen program  really helped a lot

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Thank you professor Strang, thank you MIT OCW

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
He's leading you to think, rather than proof after theorem.

### 11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit
In the uploaded lecture slides of parametric hypothesis testing there is a typo. The equals sign of H1 on Slides 29/37 and 32/37 should have been not equals sign.The same slides that are in the video ( 1:17 and 8:09),  don't have the that error.

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
Prof says @13.10 ,since Y and X are independent, we can write E[Z] = E[Y] E[1/X]

But we can this is true only if Y and 1/X are independent. Does independence of Y and X imply that Y and 1/X are independent too🤔?

I love his ackward humor xD

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what program is the lecturer using on laptop?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
For me, too many steps were skipped @20:20 . To understand this, it helps to know about elementary matrices. Basically, if you want to add k * row_i1 to row_i2, you can left multiply by m x m matrix I + M where M is all zeros except entry i2,i1 = k. To see why I + M has this effect, do the multiplication "by hand" (you can gloss over the effect of I by using the fact that matrix multiplication is distributive). Of course, the inverse of this is I + -M. This is where the 2 in his example comes from: the first (and only) step of elimination was to add -2 * the first row to the second row. So, we must add 2 * the first row to the second, which is the same as left multiplying by [[1, 0], [2, 1]]. Since this is the only elimination step, that ends up being the L matrix in this tiny example. In general, we would have to multiply a whole bunch of these inverse elementary matrices. Fortunately, that multiplication is very easy to do, because all of these elementary matrices are mostly zero, except on the diagonal.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]money

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the question the student asks " how do you get the formula?" is a valid one. The formula comes from physics. In India particularly Tamilnadu students at their 16 or 17th age learn about this calculus, and some basic but very important physics concepts. And I heard most of our students including me and my friends too have more struggles to understands these concepts. so here is this is a course for engineering students or school students?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Here's something they didn't quite spell out to me in my Linear Algebra class:

Let E be the product of row operation matrices. Let F be its inverse, FE = I.
Obviously if Ax = b then EAx = Eb (because f(x) = f(y) for all f when x = y).
But also importantly and relevantly if EAx = Eb then Ax = b:
If EAx = Eb then Ax = IAx = (FE)Ax = F(EAx) = F(Eb) = (FE)b = Ib = b.
That is, divide by E (i.e. multiply by F) on both sides to recover Ax = b.

This is the justification for the algorithm: Compute E * [A b] where E is chosen such that solutions x can be read off easily. Solving E*[A b] means x solves EAx = Eb, but then Ax = b.

So the outputs of the algorithm are in fact solutions to Ax = b.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
13th or 14th

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i like his accent

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
at 45:25 prof is talking about the other basis vectors for the column space
he says finally that since the dim of the column space is 2, he says any 2 vectors that are independent can form the column space
but is that possible? i mean the column space is a plane in 4 dimensional space right?
so if i pull out some two random independent vectors that are both out of the original column space, then their linear combinations will span an entirely new plane right?
math genius plz help this poor soul...

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Golden hair ❤️

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
10:30 shouldn't the rank of A^TA be m, so that the it's nullspace is only the nullvector? If A∈M(m x n, R) so A^TA∈M(m x m, R), right?. Hence the rank should be m. Can someone confirm this to me?

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
37:23 That is not the reduction formulae for the integral of x^n * e^x.... search the real one on Google. The G(n-1) function should be inside an integral.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
@[USERNAME]by now Prof. Strang should know that nothing is ever taken out of the tape haha.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review

Thank you Prof. Strang! I've done many MOOCS in my life, but all of them were CS related.

### 6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis
I can't understand why we introduce a new mechanism / model / "hardware" for enumerators - why do we need a "printer" mechanism when we can already write to the tape? We could just define some spans(s) of the tape as being the "output strings", no? That even happens to map directly to how most computer hardware lets the CPU communicate with peripherals - you simply write/read from a certain predefined address space in memory.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Winy have you published such a mess? Shame on you!

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
I don't know Julia, so I'm having a hard time following, but from what I can gather, all professor Edelman did in order to get "forward diff" was to define a "tuple" that holds both f(x) and f'(x). Then, he defined some operator overloads so that any iterative algorithm that calculates/approximates f(x) will also calculate f'(x). Is this right? If so, it doesn't seem that Julia would be the only language that you can do this in. All you need is polymorphism/overloading, which I think any modern language would support (e.g. C++, Python, which were both "ruled out").

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Just wanted to say that blocking the rref matrix into [[I F], [0...]] form and solving for the nullspace matrix like that is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. It seems like it shouldn't work because F could have different shape than I, but it does. And it generalizes to when F doesn't exist, which helps you remember the ideas in the next lecture.

I love that many universities and colleges do this sort of thing. Looking at different points of view on the same subject is very helpfull. This is extremely well explained, thank you.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Thanks for posting this course, the instructor is great. If I may, there is only one request, in the future if the camera could move less frequently, the camera is following the instructor too closely, making me a bit dizzy.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
I am in awe of Dr. Strang. All of his material is golden, and he such an obvious passion for teaching. Amazing communicator and academic.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
18:52  It says I'm subtracting rows from lower rows when we are multiplicating the two matrix.
Was not able to get this.was able to simply multiply the matrix using combinations of columns and rows.

### 34. Final Course Review
I've started and actually paid for many MOOCs in my life so far, but never finished any of them. This course is the first one I finished, probably in 3rd or 4th attempt. Thank you Professor Strang. Thank You MIT for sharing this wonderful material.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a question regarding last proof. It is said that we can use expression x - x0 in denominator because x is always different than x0. And in continuation of proof that same expression is equate with zero. Is it because the value is so small that we can consider it to be zero? in that case, it seems almost as a matter of convenience when we consider it to be zero, and when not?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
What an amazing man

### 16. Markov Chains I
very good teaching

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
ma boi gilbert saving my butt once again

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
5 minutes of 18:06 is enough to take care of 18.03 😂😂😂😂😂

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Seriously good lecture. Very thoughtful presentation.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
i think he breaks with the usual convention for m * n Matrix being: m rows, n collums ... which confused me, but great lecture anyways ...

edit: I was wrong
9:12 ... misunderstood what he said there, ofc the columspace has m (rows many) components, because colums go m (rows-many) components down ... thanks Robert Smits

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Awesome simplicity. Wish I had him in college

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Professor u saved me.Thanks for your lectures. Our college teacher is the worst in teaching linear algebra.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
You don't erase the board at MIT! You just raise it!  :P

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
lol, the guy doing the subtitles is really funny (students inaudible response) !!! hahahahah. This lesson is pretty well thought out !! damn i wish i went to mit :(

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
I just have to comment about this: I love how Prof Strang has this hierarchy of good matrices and not so good matrices and superior ways of decomposing them and so on. It's like every lecture he introduces another type of matrix and goes "oh yeah and this type is a really good one. I mean, it's a special case of this other type of matrix, but this one is better than the rest, it's wonderful"

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I find it almost impossible to follow. Am I the only one?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
At 47:20, why does he need to subtract row 3 from row 2 in order to calculate the cofactor of a21 ?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
this man just related a rugby ball to the eigenvectors of a matrix. damn!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
 Thanks so much for video taping it and sharing it.  This is helping so many people!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this a high school lecture?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
very basic statistics learner here and I have some question. the p (hat) explained in 55:56, does the ˆ represent an estimated value?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Thank you Professor Gilbert Strang. That's the most clear lecture (and easy to understand), I have ever listened to on the web. You are a great teacher and know your material, providing great insights where needed.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
How do you know what these 'punks' do or do not know?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Various people, in commenting, are dissatisfied with the  presentation here.  First off, the professor is clearly in command of the subject matter.  This is MIT and the pace in tough. In this third lecture he is up to a weeks-ahead point  of a srandard calculus course.  And these students, if they put the standard 3 hours of study per hour of lecture, will master the lecture material.

One may search for a presentation that is superior, but if you find it, it will not be found at the third hour lecture.  Or one may put in the work to create a satisfactory ptrsentation, to see how you yourself would teach it.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1 - cos(thetha) goes to zero faster than thetha ...

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
it was really funny when he saw his mistake :D:D

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
thank you

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I love this guy!!!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I’m confused about how he explained adding a x particular to nullspace will not give a subspace. I think it this way. Nullspace should always contain the origin, so in this case it is a plane going through the origin, since x particular is a vector not in that plane, adding them together will never give a zero, so it is not a subspace.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's clear that he likes physics. That's good.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what other lectures does this amazing lecturer have?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this teacher is to be appreciated . no matter the question , he still answers every single one with equale seriousness . my teachers never did this , they even tell me that my question is stupid sometimes

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
As much as i like the geometric profs they are extremely hand wavey.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Where can I find the online homework? I can't find it in OCW.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]S : Actually, vectors crop up everywhere in physics. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism involve vectors, and where would we be today without an understanding of electricity? You wouldn't be watching this on your computer for a start.  

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Likely they are too stupid to follow.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]not in 6th grade but in 10th grade :p

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
average value of a function f(x,y) in a region r  is what?

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Was anybody else screaming out "LIKELIHOOD" at 38:45??

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
' don't feel rushed to cover everything...just stay with the class" Wonderful piece of advice for us teachers.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He's a bit slow explaining in my taste, but still I think he's a great professor 

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
36:19 OOpsssssssssssss

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My brain is degenerating as he explains the degenerate critical points tbh

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I'm just curious about null space.
So pretty much can I put any numbers into null space if column vectors can make the result 0?
For example, at 20:18,
instead of having 
-2     2
1      0
0     -2
0      1



Can I have two column vectors as null space
0         1
-1       -1/2
1         -2
0          2

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
such a great lecuture!

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Completed 18.02.
Thank you MIT OCW and Prof. Denis Auroux!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Que se supone que está explicando..????  está demostrando saltándose pasos de álgebra como si por eso fuera a ser mejor demostración... que quiere demostrar...  que sabe y que es chingón...  a los estudiantes hay que poner cada paso y exponer con claridad, nadie puede asimilar eso en una clase...  PÉSIMA EXPLICACIÓN

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
so inspiring.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Ty

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
At 23:39 why q2 goes to q1 if the input is zero, why not it has circle above it like q1.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you are wondering he is using the slope-point formula in minute 30:38. 
I would also appreciate if someone can explain to me why he can use O(x²) in minute 47:30 to describe values with bigger exponents then 2 like x³,x⁴ and higher.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
迷一般的斐波那契数列通项公式，原来是这么来的！

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
One of the best teachers! As a viewer of this course you feel the passion and love for math. He feels the math and can transfer his knowledge to other people. Well explained! Top!

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Genius. Fantastic.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
doesnt the application of simpson's rule require n to be an even number?

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the best professor evvvvvvvvver

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
@[USERNAME] does not matter since det A is equal to det A transpose

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
great. enlightening lecture

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice video!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
*8008*

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The average 0 to 1 value of skin covered by awesome tattoos under David Jerison's lecture shirts is probably 1

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Because proving is math.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
26:05 "What did it cost?"
~40:00 "Everything"

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Hi, does anybody know the name of the book hes always referring to? :)

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
In the quiz 3 solutions on the course page, there's an error at the last bit of it. The equation should have been Av1 = sigma1u1, it got the v and the u misplaced. Don't know where to report it so I came here lol..

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
"But, after class - TO MY SORROW - a student tells me, 'Wait a minute that [third vector] is not independent...'"
I love it.  What other professor brings this kind of passion to linear algebra?  This is what makes real in the flesh lectures worthwhile.  

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
43:41 I disagree.Since two solutionsa are Col [0,-1,1] & col [1,0,0] and a simple linear combination is col[1,-1,1] ,which is not a solution that means above two vector are just scattered vectors and dont even form a plane which skips origin.Am I right?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thanks

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dr. Auroux is terrific at impromptu sketching. 19:14, look at the neatness of all six boards!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
hello to any fellow online multi students if y'all are passing by!! :D

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Doc tells you that some subjects are well-known. But,  the students' questions we can see that  subjects not so clear for them.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
@32:00, Prof mentions "if the eigenvalues are far apart, that's when we have problems".  What does he mean by that?

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Just to check, so at about 27:38 the phi(k - j) = z? not y?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
that was awesome.

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For the condition to be a vector field, that seems like the formulation that the curl of the gradient of f=0 , meaning that its direction does not change and hence is a scalar.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hello MIT, I don't think this professor's style is my favorite, however I can't say thank you enough for your putting all these videos including recitations for free. Looking forward to your new updates.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
I always thought the N-1 was related to the fact that the variance of a single object is undefined (or at least nonsensical), so the N-1 ensures this is reflected in the maths? As well as something related to the unbiasedness of the estimator etc.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lec 1:  819k views,  last lecture:  57k views... Only the strongest survive

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Hi. Perhaps you could help me. If there are 6 greyhounds in a race, and they all have an equal chance of winning or coming second place, and if I put money on four out of the six greyhounds, what are the odds that one of my four selections will be successful (that is, how likely is it that either one of my four selections will come first or second)??? Hope you can help me! Cheers!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When a wise man points at the moon, the fool looks at his finger.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Nice explanation

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I liked the lecture 7. It is like you finally get the result of e at the end of al those lengthy steps

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
when i first run into linear algebra at university i was so stuck to understand even the basic topics of my courses. then after 2-3 years i discovered mr. Strang's lectures and i have to say i am so grateful for this professor because his teaching aproach made me understang the whole concept of linear algebra and i actually found it very interesting for the first time in my life. Plus i finally passed my courses after all these years xD god bless you mr. Strang :)

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I tried to learn the concept from this video months ago and I swear he made me scared.

WHY DOES HE MAKE IT SOUND SO DIFFICULT???

This whole lecture is based on the point-slope equation which is really just the slope formula anyway. 

How do you get slope m?
(y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) = m --> Slope

Then, get the x's over to the m

y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)  --> point-slope equation
Then, we solve for y,
y = m(x - x_0) + y_0 --> Linearization

He makes it seem as if the eq comes out of thin air.. :o

### Lecture 25: Power Series and the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem
Wut?

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
I just came for the first 5 min then I watched it till the end! So engrossing!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thanx alot for this great lectures, i´m from Portugal and I´m amazed with this oportunity that M.I.T. gave to every one around the world M.I.T.believes in a better world where everyone can get free high quality education. With this actitude of M.I.T., i´m starting to baleave myself that a better world is possible.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
He is a god at linear algebra but from the statistics perspective, he failed.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
very good service given by MIT for other students who cant study at MIT
Thanks to MIT

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The gold starts from 5:22

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wtf :D Thats very easy in Germany you lern this in der 11th grade

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
y not try diagonal method? its 200% more easy right?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished!. 18.01. Will begin shortly 18.02 as well. Also finished 6.042J / 18.062J,  fnished supplementary Single & multi by Herbert  Gross. ( btw rest in peace )  had a break from 6.00 ( will continue and finish soon ) . Thank you for these amazing lectures MIT !

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
@[USERNAME]
Sorry for my bad English, it is not my mother language, but I "believe" I can improve. I write in Portuguese and French very well thanks.
Any way thanks again for notating, next time I will put it first in the word corrector.


### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
This is a lecture of the best of the best quality. Thrilling

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Well thanks prof.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sir, where is lecture 8? i cant find it?


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
الله يجزاكم خيراً.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thank you Sir for these 2 series: Real Analysis and Functional Analysis. Can we be expectant of Complex Analysis?

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ 49:17 when he writes (-1) is actually correct. Why's it +1 when -e0 is -(1) seeing as e0 is 1? Great lecture though, seriously interesting. Makes me kind of want to do Mathematics in University, and I know this is just one lecture, but it doesn't seem to be as hard as I thought it would be. I guess it's just the fact that most people hate Math and find it super difficult, but I found this lecture enjoyable! Lol, sometimes can't believe I'm one to love Maths...

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Can't remember last time i was so pleased learning maths, apart from a few 3b1b vids.
Thanks Sr.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Okay, if anyone is like me who is interested in Linear Algebra and not necessarily Differential Equations, but still wants to understand this lecture for the sake of completeness in this course, here is the list of all the Differential Equations theory you need for this lecture and where you can find content to learn it:

1. Separable differential equations - Khan Academy - this is for v(t)=exp(Lambda t) v(0)
2. 2nd order linear homogeneous equations - Khan Academy - you need this if you want to understand one calculation in the next item on this list (quick to learn anyways)
3. Systems of differential equations - MIT OCW 18.03, lectures 24 and 25 - basically does the first example in this lecture, but actually goes through the steps of explaining what is happening, highly recommended to watch both videos

As someone who is unlikely to apply a whole lot of differential equations in the future, I still found this lecture useful to reinforce the properties of Eigenstuff from the previous lecture, also the very last bit of the lecture is very cool

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
TRULY BRILLIANT PROFESSOR! YOU HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT YOU'RE A FUCKING GENIUS WHO KNOWS HOW TO DO LINEAR ALGEBRA.

NOW WHY DON'T YOU TRY TEACHING YOUR STUDENTS HOW TO DO LINEAR ALGEBRA.

AHAHAHA LOL

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a math degree and I still enjoy these lectures. Auroux is a great lecturer.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a feeling that the lecturer does not know how to prove the law of cosines.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Because all this stuff is very easy. It is linear algebra 101

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is it just me or do state colleges have a completely different syllabus?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The area underneath the line y = f(x) over a very small distance, d.x , being d.x f(x), making allowance for infinitesimal error as negligible, one discovers the change in the area under the line y=f(x), d.y , to be d.x[f(x + d.x) - f(x)], and declares the differential therefrom ... or something like that, this being in pursuit of a more visual and intuitively obvious statement of the root understanding of differentials.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You are right: in italian calculus courses there are better proofs, NOT better professors. Big difference here! :) We have a long math tradition but I think our teachers are now too proud and far from students. It isn't a coincidence that there aren't italian open courses on YouTube! Anyway, I'm very sorry for your bad experience, I hope you will have better experiences with italian colleagues.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thankyou sir for very conceptual lecture thank you MIT open course feels like in the class awesome technical support

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's in the first 20 seconds of the video?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
if you are not familiar with laplace transform, especially coming from a signal and system background, you do get lost in here, it's not because of your poor understanding. But for EE, this is an essential and magic piece!

### 34. Final Course Review
Interesting to see that even in his last lecture he keeps on solving questions, where most others tell some stories or engage time unproductively...

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
good  informative lecture .

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
a smoooooth lecture indeed

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
One of my heroes! Hats off Mr.Strang, you inspire a lot of people :)

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
1:04:03 he's definitely say drug

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I've learnt Crammers rule , transposing , integration basics, differential basics ......  Am I doing ryt . I still don't know how this can be applied

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
13:22
lec starting point

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To treenabalds,

It's because the second derivative of sinθ is -sinθ, it is EXCATLY zero when you plug θ=0.
That is, f''(0)=0.

And for cosθ, the first and third derivatives are EXCATLY zero when you plug θ=0. That is, f'(0) and f'''(0) are zero.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
@[USERNAME]why did we count the fix-up cost from just one of the D's. Shouldn't it be twice since we have D and -D in the matrix?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
"Oh god, come out right here!" ... "Thank you, God!" XD I was dying at those parts of the lecture. Not only does he teach skillfully, he's hilarious too.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
P({x,y | 0<x,y<1,(x,y)!=(a,b)}) = 1 - p({x={a,b}) < 1 since p({x={a,b}) > 0 , supposed that p_1 = p({x={a,b}) than p_1 = a in reals such that for all b in reals a < b (which is possible since the real numbers are uncountable infinite) , I'm not quite sure that I expressed this right, but I think its a good resolution of the question asked in 11:10

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Never using this in real life.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
22:30 that's pretty crazy that the probably of a specific point is 0, but the area of the sample space is > 0.

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Really useful. Thanks a lot

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Es fácil, no se porque se complican tanto. Gracias por el material, gracias al MIT.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
lovely 21:14

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This man desirves an youtube award!!!!

### 10. Computation History Method
16:45 Another very simple proof that there is no (finite) match: None of the dominoes is a possible ending point, because none of the pairs have matching suffixes.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Gauss thought of it because he was born earlier 😂 I died.

Then he said died earlier too. I died again.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
The second basis for R^3 is not a basis, since -(1,1,2)+2*(2,2,5)=(3,3,8); i.e., the vectors are not linearly independent.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
no. I meant the points he makes with the chalk all the time for no reason :-)

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does this guy always makes points after every word?!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
This is so spectacularly good.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have just one question: How 1/2 (2Xo)(2Yo)= 2XoYo=2? If we do 1/2 *2 (XoYo) we are left with XoYo which i don't think is equal to 2 :X 

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I REALLY tried to focus on this but I can’t math is just not my thing

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is a great lesson. I remember learning this a long time ago; it is all coming back.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So I guess you misunderstood the structure of the courses. They can't assume that you remember the stuff you did in high school so they sort of repeat it in the first units of the courses to build on that.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Multivariable calculus and linear algebra seem to go hand in hand.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I'm pretty sure he meant parallel, but no one bothered to correct him.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
pena que nao entendk ingles kk

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I am afraid that the teacher has mistakenly reversed the elements (2,2) and (2,3).  They are supposed to be -2 and 2 respectively, not 2 and -2. In fact it's 3 * (1, 2, 1) = (3, 6, 3), hence (3, 6, 3) - (3, 8, 1) = (0, -2, 2).

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great explanation of the trapezoidal rule

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
@[USERNAME]But how do we know B is invertable? I found a proof that does not assume B is invertable:

Suppose we have x such that ABx = lambda * x. Left multiply both sides by B: BABx = lambda * Bx. This shows that Bx is an eigen vector of BA, and its eigen value is lambda.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I envy MIT students very much!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would be very happy if you people add subtitles! It does not have to be in my language. English is fine.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
how did Gilbert age so much in the past 3-4 years? I'm worried for him...

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you professor

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Must say, the students in this course are not up to the mark. People in Asian, East European countries are far ahead compared to their American counterparts. Although, the professor is great and makes every effort to answer their rudimentary questions.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

He made some nonintuitive things intuitive with just some simple example, love his videos

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ok. You can touch the tangient point you find the fourt dimension.....:)


### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]it's just the same problem done in a different way... he's setting dA/dx=0 to get the critical point.. just like he did, in the first method he used to solve the problem...

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Professor Strang = ❤️❤️❤️❤️

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I am binge watching this series .....at the end of each one I tell myself that I will watch just one more episode :) !!

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone can help? I need a mathematical, not intuitive, proof... =(


### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Which course is better, this one or the Harvard one ?

Behold, the god of teaching! Great lecture.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
On 4:11, the nullspace vector isn't composed by 5 zeros?

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks from the bottom of my heart BTW for tese videos.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
For the first time I envy students in MIT. Because they have such genius lectures to attend.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
15:00 How to get all possible combinations?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Fantastic!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
form is pathetic

@[USERNAME]hi is from France

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Ah.  Well, jokes don't transfer well through text... Sorry about that.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Who disliked this video?
Just give me their names and I'll cut their heads off.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the best lecture i've ever seen..... he's really >>>WOW

In addation to that, he speaks batter than native speakers'.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
do the students in mit have only one physics math and chem class a week how do they finish the portions


### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Hahaha, at 24:06, I thought the exact same thing, "prof, what are you saying??"

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Respected sir, may god bless you,. You will live for more than 100 years, you are a legend. Love from India ❤️

外国的学生没中国的聪明。

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
great lecture... awesome video... thank you for posting it.... 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks MIT, i'm from Colombia and i think these classes are very important for me, because i'm studying engineering in the National University of Colombia :)

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
"lemme give an example, okay BRILLIANT example" That "brilliant" always gets me 

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
As a PhD guy, I can say if you master in this course, actually you master at LOTS of high-level subjects like econometrics, engineering, applied math, chemistry etc. Those "graduate" level courses sometimes just repeat the basic ideas from this course and make them hard to understand.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
The way he parameterized the directional derivative was really confusing. 

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
13:05 that S looks perfect

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The Green's Theorem is only to work if the curve is closed...

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I really have to think and imagine a lot in this lecture and I loved it

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
42:27 we see Euler again, that guy never stops 😂✨

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Crystal clear explanation. Nice!

nice class

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
32:08 "i had a 50/50 chance and life let me down" LOL

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
37:23 he just gave an idea to DCEU for a superhero ... the invertible man.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I think the nearest distance between Clinton and Monica could be -16cm

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm sure doing the proofs are part of their problem sets and recitation.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
thankyou sir!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]why must the subspace (the plane) go through the origin?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I love how he continues to pretend that he just makes up all his examples ad hoc while in the end it always turns out that he prepped all of it in advance. "Oh, what a great suprise that it worked out so well!!"

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what was the point of the linear approximation for the GPS example? why not just plug the velocity into the original equation? is it because you save on computation time or something?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank You Prof. David Jerison and Prof. Muller. 
Completed the whole Lecture series just now.
18/4/22

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] Why the hell are you taking multivariable calculus in high school

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh, hi kermit

### 4. Counting
Thanks Mit

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I just started to think that matrices are magical things

@[USERNAME]You're right !

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
now i can feel the art of the linear algebra

### 12. Time Complexity
37:15 i guess that big time function cannot be found without using Zorn's lemma

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you MIT, Thank you so much

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
where can I find a complete derivation of the formula z=z0 + a(x-x0) + b(y-y0) using parametric equations as he suggested at 8:38? I tried to do what he said but no luck!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Professor Stang's lectures are best heard at 1.75 speed :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You can find the value 2*y0, when the derivative of 1/x cut the Y exe, by making similar triangles. If the slope reflects a change from y0 to 0 when X changes from x0 to 2*x0 , so it should change from y0 to 2*y0 when X changes from x0 to 0. It's easiest to see in a graph.

The notation f' is from Lagrange, not Newton. I love MITOCW. Thanks!

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Lectures are super useful.  Are there any answers to the assignments if I ma not enrolled to the MIT?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
21:00 Inverse Matrix

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Dr. Strang is an MIT math legend forever.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
buen curso si señor

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Thanks prof.

### 34. Final Course Review
the applause was too short!




or maybe it's because I watched this at 1.5x--and dared to venture 2x for parts of this last lecture in my rush to finish the course :D

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
2:47 the straightest free-hand coordinate system I've ever seen!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Thanks, teacher , and MIT, it help me a lot to understand Linear Algebra

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
i stop at 24:00 so i remember next time dont mind my comment

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is a great introduction to vector fields. When taught abstractly, it can be hard to visualise, so even the use of elementary examples makes a difference.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like the way he teaches.  Many years ago when I took Single Variable Calculus, a high school classmate and I used to sit in the back of class and make up short cuts to confuse the professor.  We both aced the class.

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Crystal clear! Thank you very much for sharing it

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
How do you know how "smart" they are?  Try to get a scholarship-that is the existing solution to wealth disparity, not a wish!  There are great professors everywhere, but I agree this one is particularly good.  Best of luck!

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lol. Me too


### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Take a bow Sir. You are a Gem of gems.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this entire course a combination of calc 1 and 2? Or just calc 1. I see the next course is multi-variable which is often known as calc 3.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, all I was ever taught was the shortcut..

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I am happy that I could learn from MIT... Thank you sir

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
31:30 the more meaningful ways of answering, continue with implicit differentiation
45:20 related rates

### 16. Markov Chains I
Master class in presenting complex concepts -- state by state.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
"Murderers...cheaters on quizzes" - 17:41

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Spherical cap of radius r and height h: pi*(h^2)*(3r-h)/3. Radius r is the radius of the sphere, not of the cap. Here r=1 and h=1-1/sqrt(2) which gives the answer. My HP-50g gives it as (8-5*sqrt(2))*pi/12 which is the same that was on the lecture. Personally I don't like roots in denominators in answers.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't think I will ever get an admission from MIT :) but being able to listen to lectures from my dream school online for free is truly awesome! Thank you for these wonderful lectures.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Index for you guys
5:46 Introduction to the course
9:50 beginning of first class
25:50 third axiom
42:15 discrete uniform law example

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Denis Auroux's focusing this lecture on physics is important but there's too much to say in too short of time.
That he mentioned the Maxwell Equations is important. His focus on classical mechanics is good. What he left out of his discussion of square matrices multiploed into the column vector was the concept of Eigen Value and Eigen Vector was that in 1925 Heisenberg for square matrices of infinite order created quantum mechanics

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
I hope ona day I could be part of the MIT

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of these days I'm going to invent an AI real time internet fed algorithm that detects gaps in the logical path of a learning process, both from a student and from a learning resource standpoints. Just... let me finish these videos first.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
so...how to find the proper "shift"?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
his drawings are awesome...

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
BTW, the three error is called "imprinting". Because of the 3 in the numerator, it was imprinted in the solution which was now imprinted into the checking process. As a math tutor, this happens all the time in my lessons. There are about 3 ways to avoid or resolve imprinting. I usually cover this in my first private lesson of one on one.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
God he is good !! but if you are having trouble visualizing the 9D space (lol) check out the 3Blue1Brown series on Linear Algebra.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where does he prove that sin(x)/x= 1?


### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
from lecture 1 until here. Thanks MIT

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
03:41 ah-ha! the so-called traffic light vector

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At the beggining of the lecture prof. Miller told an excellent joke. I suppose the joke was good  only for mathematicians to laugh at. From the resonse it seems that the students are far from being mathemticians , because nobody laughed :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10 people were 10 years old

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Excellent professor and lectures!! Thank you!

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
very handsome man with a nice British accent. I hope he doesn't pulverize me on my linear algebra final.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I dont undertand why the eigenvectors are [lamba_1  1] and [lamba_2 1] at 49:19...
since it is NOT true that ((1 - lamba) * (lamba)) + 1 is lamba^2 - lamba - 1 ... or it is? or what is happening?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
What a cute professor


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a question.
What was that "Junk" part?
How did he get there?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best handwriting includes writing everything in capital letters!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, just wow.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
+Frantisek Dracek He's not assuming that r is constant. He uses the formula for an area element for a curve r(theta) in polar coordinates.

What he says is when you rewrite Kepler's second law using the formula for area in polar coordinates you get conservation of angular momentum.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]also, just because some people didnt have some chapters on the school books, doesnt make them stupid :P

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So the j term you always make the negative, correct?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]for completeness, how would you prove that sin x < x < tan x in a small interval containing 0?

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you MIT for such a good course

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Wait, in the needle problem, you're calculating the probability for the needle to crosse only one of the lines (the top one).  But in your paper clip experiment, you counted all those that intersected both lines.  isn't that a flaw?  How would you count for the needle intersecting the other line which would be (d-x) away from the center of the needle.  Do we do l/2sin(theta)>=(d-x)?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
At 25:00  Mr. Stang wrote (row 1) transpose x equals 0, but I don't really understand.
I was thinking about to remove the "transpose" thing, and I was sooo confused.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Dr. Strang, I owe you my livelihood. I would never have gotten the opportunities in life that I've had without your lectures and I'm excited to go through this playlist to keep improving. <3

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Much better thant our teacher.....

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
This guy gets it. Intuition is a must. Its actually the first time I saw a teacher teaching a subject the exact way I would.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Very fantastic lecture 👍

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love how at 23:28, he gives the students that cheeky grin right before doing his erasing trick

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Very Good Content !!!!!!!

🤙👌💪

👏👏👏👏👏👏

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank u Prof.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
any recommended books on understanding the mathematical basis for statistics as covered in this lecture?

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
I really love how he pronounces "cookbook". I swear I've even started reading my textbook using his accent in my head.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is a work of art!

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
can anybody explain why he place the solid in z plane with 0 x and 0 y,
it is the plane where direction of force is directed.

### 16. Markov Chains I
nice lec

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't care for this professor. I find him to be too boring. I enjoy math, but this man makes me want to fall asleep.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
God bless you, Professor Strang.

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
What a big chalk!!!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Took 18.06 in 1992 and he taught it.  Great stuff, and an awesome professor.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Isn't CLT about the distribution of your estimated mean being normal (rather than calculating the mean from a very large sample)? i.e. calculate your mean 1000 times and those 1000 means will follow a normal distribution

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man....MIT student's are lucky to have such professors ...

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished in COVID 19 July Quarantine 2020.
Many thanks to  Prof. David Jerison, MIT and OCW

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At last. my dream. I'm studying at MIT! Thanks OCW!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Here I am trying to learn English, with a french accent teacher who teach statistics. What is the possibility I am be successful?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the concept of total differential sounds a little abstract initially. I finally got a better understanding after the whole lecture, plus the aid of Wikipedia. 

"Calculation of the total derivative of f with respect to t  does not assume that the other arguments are constant while t varies ... "

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How young are these students? I'm 17 and we've started integrating already.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
laughter @ 32:46

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really apreciate this lectures (on any subject) and your effort. Thank you very much. Is there any lecture, in other subject, which makes reference to hyperbolic functions and inverse functions?

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
能听Gilbert Strang教授的课是我的荣幸！

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
they tend to forget its MIT... these guys aren't dumb to teach students beginner calc... or you could think of it as a refresher... 

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this helps alot.. thanks...

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Bruh our university has his book as a recommendation lol

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Really got the points!
First time in my life I have completed a lecture on math and also learned multiple new things!
All concepts got cleared.
Thank you Gilbert Strang for introducing me to LA.
Respect++;

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Things we are not supposed to know:
1- The Fight Club
2- Sex
3- Determinants (25:50)

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yes, finally i understand

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
44:40 I am lost here.
Especially because EA = I ,  then E * I = E. The math I've been learning for years is confusing me.
Is the identity matrix like a 1? For example, 3 * 1 = 3. So 3 is the E and I is the 1?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know physics and kepler's law， but I never think it like this. thank you very much！

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Is this really MIT?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Hi professor and online collegueas. I'm a control engineering student, so Linear Algebra is the essential of my field of study. Despite I've taken a linear algebra course before and even sophisticated discussions in control systems, I never truly understood until now why it is better to think using columns instead of using rows. But now it's totally clear in my mind, so thank you very much, professor Gilbert. I'm anxious for the next classes.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
39:03 typo in subtitle, “only r genuine independent equations...” should be right, not “are” in place of “r”. Thanks a lot!!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
(-1)(1,1,2)+2(2,2,5)=(3,3,8).

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Wow...looks like he aged 30 years in the last 10...

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions

### 34. Final Course Review
I really enjoyed these lessons. If you tell a European student that during an entire linear algebra course only once did the professor write the word PROOF on the blackboard, he will never believe you!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
hahaha, dau lai vo do thoi, phai o do thoi :D:D:D:D thuong de xap dat roi, deo cho bon may loi dung :D do mat day.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
jmaginary is totally a word.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]I think x is limited to numbers between 0 and 1

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I learn more about calculus from physics lessons than from this calculus class.   That's disturbing in the sense that understanding calculus is infinitely easier when applied to physical phenomena which invariably involve it.

Why..  really why.. is mathematics taught in such an amorphous way?
The curve of "something" doesn't really ground me in any way..  I hate that.

Calculus teachers of the world, please interpolate REAL WORLD understanding  into math.  You will encounter far less confusion.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
universe sent him to teach LA

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
cool mit

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Thank you so much.👌

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A power series function becomes a logarithmic function by the diagonalisation..

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Prof. Strang really rushed the topic of eigenvalue and eigenvector.
I understood every lecture in this series except this.
I think I will have to check Khan Academy.

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
I like the way he makes "measures" seem easy to understand

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
he is a legend
thanks MIT

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
After three or more years of studying linear algebra, I finally understood the fundamental meaning of SVD ... really took me a long long way to get here... Thank you Dr. Strang.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
21:47 those blackboards are very nice actually.
I also watched the Stanford physics lectures (by professor Leonard Susskind), and they also have very nice blackboards (whiteboards actually).
I found that top universities always have excellent blackboards, because those good professors always prefer to do the demonstrations and calculations by themselves on the board.

My uni was very mediocre and so were the teachers. after a whole semester they seldom wrote anything on the board, all they do is repeating what's on the textbook and playing the powerpoint with most calculations and results already written on it, 
One exception was my Mathematical Physics professor, he was a brilliant guy and he always do the demonstrations on the board, and during classes we can often hear him complain about the size of the board and the poor quality of the chalk :)

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Is it me or Gilbert Strang's lecture delivery is "similar" to Frank Underwood's dialogue delivery ?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How would 1/2 lead to Fractional Math? 

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
How admirably clear.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
My final course in college. Loved statistics and can be used in real life after college.  Level of significance 3.14, mode. mean  sample population chi square.  love it This professor seems really good at teaching and keeping the class fun

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
Professor Strang thank you for explaining and analyzing Definitions and Inequalities  from probability and statistics. The pictures and examples really help me to understand the quality of this lecture.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The notes made no sense. This lecture made it seem so simple

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Anyone know how to find the null space using sagemath please?

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the confusion arises from leibniz notation where d^2/dx^2 would represent the second derivative.  still pretty dumb question though aha

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
48:47 Random burp

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Playing this at 2

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why students do not participate in the lecture?
MIT is probably the best technical university, but the way of teaching which lecturer shows isn't good. Maths requires talking about the problem and solving it together. The lecturer should ask student what to do in some examples.
It's the the best way to remember most from the lecture.
 
Greetings from  Materials Engineering faculty from Warsaw University of Technology 



### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
very nice best taecher

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Anyone noticed that there were no students (at least in the front 6 rows) in this lecture?

                       2 6

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you do have him


### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I am crying right now. I am an economics student and I have been waiting for MIT OCW to release lectures on Real Analysis for so long. My whole mathematical economics training has been due to MIT OCW from calculus, linear algebra, differential equations to statistics and ML. Thank you MIT.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
How did people learn linear algebra before Gilbert was born?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thanks for everything ❤

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
what happened to the sound this time? loool more echo this time
 IM absolutely loving studying this way its soooo better than reading GODDAMN books! 
he has great proficiency.
but dont forget to practice problems on the topics u go thru it helps retain the lecture ideas

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
sets of :size is equal ; when 2 or more  sets   equal a quality  in one or more of the  *number logic strategies to arrive at a sum of &that sum ,which can be any defined by  theory that hold the axioms of math * at a guess

### Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem
Timestamps and Summary for Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem

0:00 - Recap of Lecture 2
Last lecture: linear operators between normed vector spaces are continuous if and only if they are bounded. The space of bounded operators between two such NVS's itself forms an NVS, under the operator norm. When the target is a Banach space, this space of bounded operators also becomes Banach: this is a way to identify new Banach spaces from existing ones, by considering all bounded operators into them. 

0:59 - Subspaces
A subspace of a given vector space is internally closed under addition and scaling (linear combinations). Theorem: a subspace W of a Banach space V is itself Banach if and only if it is a closed subspace of V with respect to the metric induced by the norm. Closure amounts to showing that W contains all of its limit points (every convergent sequence in W has its limit in W). We can take any sequence in W; by hypothesis (completeness) it is Cauchy and converges in W. Conversely, if the subspace is closed, we can take a Cauchy sequence in W -- regarding it as a sequence in the ambient Banach space V, it converges to an element in W by closure. This shows every Cauchy sequence in W converges in W, so W is Banach. 

5:14 - Quotient Spaces
Another crucial way to form new spaces from old by passing to substructures involves the process of taking quotients. Given a subspace W of V, introduce (and verify) an equivalence relation on vectors in V by identifying two vectors together if their difference lies in W. This allows us to form the quotient set V/W under that equivalence relation; furthermore, it naturally inherits the operations from V and becomes a vector space in its own right. 

11:31 - From Seminorms to Norms
Recall that a seminorm satisfies homogeneity and the triangle inequality, but not necessarily definiteness -- consider the norm of the derivative of a function; it exhibits the former two properties but resolves to zero on constant functions. Theorem: a seminorm on a vector space descends to a norm on its quotient taken with the subspace of all vectors on which the seminorm is zero. Intuitively: the presence of vectors with seminorm zero represent an "obstruction" of the seminorm from becoming a norm. By collapsing the obstruction in the quotient, we obtain a true norm. 

23:11 - Baire Category Theorem
A cornerstone of general topology with vital applications in analysis. The version given here states that if a complete metric space can be expressed as the countable union of closed sets, then at least one of the closed sets contains an open ball (eq. has an interior point/nonempty interior). It can be reformulated to state that the countable intersection of open, dense sets in a complete metric space remains dense. (Note: a second result, not as relevant to functional analysis, states that the same holds true for locally compact regular spaces. This is especially important in the study of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The version proven here requires some form of the Axiom of Choice; over ZF it turns out equivalent to a weaker form of Choice that is sufficient to build up most of real analysis). 

50:39 - The Uniform Boundedness Theorem
Our first major functional analysis result: it states that a sequence of pointwise-bounded operators on a Banach space is also bounded uniformly. More precisely, a sequence of linear operators from a Banach space to a normed vector space is bounded uniformly in the operator norm as soon as each individual operator is bounded. By showing that each of these operators have bounds that might vary with each point, this theorem claims that a bound can be chosen for all operators in the sequence that is independent of the point, and can be applied globally.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm amazed these students had not seen the law of cosines. It seems that they are not a big deal after all

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Matrices; inverse matrices From Your

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I don't understand 11:25 why A square can be written in the way on the blackboard. I think A^2 should be (S Lambda S^-1)^T   (S Lambda S^-1), the result differs from the one on the blackboard. Could someone explain this?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This man is a legend. Thanks for everything.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I know people your age who were doing calc 3 and diffy q's, someone's dick is always bigger.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is a great lecture. the way he handled the law of cosines off the cuff was brilliant. 

### 18. Properties of Determinants
best det class i ever had.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did anyone else have to playback speed at .25x??😂😂😂😂

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Legend

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
31:53 - my first "ahaaaaa" moment...so excited to move forward with this course, just brilliant!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
What an elegant way of lecturing. Thank you, sir.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You could say that about a lot of math, the trick isn't usually in doing the algebra. It's understanding the relationships between numbers and equations. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This was recorded using professional equipment (and with a lot of post-processing). Not the kind of camera you can just bring to lecture and film your professor with.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Thank goodness for browser extensions. Setting this video to Mono makes it much easier to listen to. :D

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Love your lectures. Thank you Sir

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
All mathematicians told that trisecting angles are impossible! I am Taha M. Muhammad telling "It is possible!". All can look at my trisecting invention "Taha's Geometry Theory" Step 1 - step 2- step 3. May be you have no idea about steps. Shortly, all of professors even honorable Einstein wanted to think to divide an angle directly into 3, but my theory is you are at ground level then think up tp one step on stairs, then go to and relax at step 3. YouTube is showing you how I trisect angles(above 0 to 360) degrees. Thank you for Universalities and math professionals who ignored my Qs and e-mails about trisecting. I thing may age is 76, poor, no job, and not famous then told "Who is this needs to trisect angles and Einstein did no do it!"

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
what textbook did they use?

### 3. Independence
Went over my head. 
I have to rewatch.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Diagonal is king

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I am overjoyed by this lecture!! A beautiful system of linear (in)dependencies.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
can someone please explain the ending statements he made about the second property

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’m so surprise. This should be a AP high school class. MIT student should be taking Linear Algebra and ODE first year.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
funny guy

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

The lectures on backpropagation is ok, need the textbook referenced.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
by definition a function cannot produce 2 y's for a given x. so, equation for unit circle is not a function but both y=sqroot(1-x^2) or y=-sqroot(1-x^2) are.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the average mark for MIT students (if you know specifically calc. courses great)?

### Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!
Could we have the SGD convergence proof by Prof. Sra.
I was expecting that to be covered in Lec - 27 but due to lack of time, it was covered in subsequent lectures which weren't posted online.
Thank You

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
That's how good these students are, because I happen to know that there is an audience.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Thanks for the lecture series! Lecturers having to look at notes is bizarre to me, is it a common thing at MIT / US Universities?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
40:41 why empty again?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Most boring mti class

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Didn't know 18.06 existed for centuries lol. The exam from year zero.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
professor Strang you are excellent. Thanks a lot to you and MIT for these lectures and to all the supporters of OCW.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
positive definite matrix judgement is very useful and the details are well explained

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
It makes me a little bit sad he has grown this old. I still want him to be teaching with that much energy and patience as we see him teach the class of 2005

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Ok ... 7 is a lucky number ... :D

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
truly a great intro to statistics. by the way, the variance estimator of gaussian is a biased one, I think [1/(N-1)] ∑(xi - µ)^2 would be a better choice

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
GREAT

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I loved subspaces more than spaces.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Hi everyone! Is it enough to watch video lectures, or should I read his textbook too? I found only shorten version with several chapters out. Is it critical to read the textbook too?

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
Great lecture!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
He is the best teacher i've ever had.  How can i get in touch with him?  Please!!! Thank you so much.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This guy is a beautiful example of how much value is added to a simple lecture, when teh lecturer knows his subject deeply and apprecaite what it is going to be used for at higher levels. He is doing an excellent job conveying the basics while teaching the students how he thinks. This is going to drive the students that just want to know how to solve the problem nuts, and be a boon in the long run for the really bright and intuitively deep students. I have never seen matrices taught with such love. I say this as a teacher that teaches basic matrix math.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"baby example"

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
40:51
No pun intended?

### 13. Bernoulli Process
This lecturer is absolutely amazing.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I love his course and book about Linear Algebra.Thanks very much

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Because this is single variable calculus, not algebra. 


### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]I´m glad they were made to be found! MIT rocks, more should follow their example!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Love your name.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
The two dimensional sound channel matrix has only one independent vector. Bad one.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Love this man, thanks MIT for looking out for us!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Finally someone who can explain image/range/column space clearly!!!  

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
Professor Strang this lecture explains  in great detail Clusters in Graphs and how Eigenvectors  determine Clusters. The role of Spectral Clustering and it's start with the Laplacian Matrix. Thanks to MIT for all these fantastic lectures.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Would any one please explain what did the professor mean between 13:13 and 13:44?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
if this professor's class would be a column vector, it will definitely be linearly independent of all other linear algebra classes. He squeezes in new and interesting stuff that is not in the other vectors

### 19. Principal Component Analysis

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
After the first lecture's lopsided assault on my auditory sensory apparatus, this lecture is like an eargasm. RELIEF!

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Give this man a medal !

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Why is it that if there are more unknowns than there are equations there exists a non-zero solution to Ax=0?

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How do you get to chose a random number for x? like x=0. How is this possible? what am I missing?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is where the money is at

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I just realized multivariable calculus is the prereq of this course. I understand most of the part but there was confusion sometimes. Now I need to take cal 3 so I can continue these awesome lectures from professor Strang.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I don't understand the point he was trying to drive with the final 5 minutes or so. I imagine it will become more clear in the next lecture.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get it

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am an IITian. We do have some professors who teach this well. Most are very boring. Thanks, MIT.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anybody who understand why he did 45/365? Is 45 the day 45 or what is it?

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
❤️  ❤️  ❤️

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Awful course!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
for those unaware, this video was originally uploaded in very bad quality (you willl see complaints about this in the next one) and MIT OCW claimed to have lost the original recording and thus were unable to upload in higher quality. Fortunately, the seem to have found the tapes. Thanks MIT OCW!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
14:44

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Its too easy.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I love reviews.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For all of you who are lost in this conference, don't worry, if you are just starting your career and have not seen calculus or differential equations, this will be almost impossible to understand, I think this conference seeks to show the potential of linear algebra in other fields, and I don't think it is necessary to fully understand it if you are just starting out, don't get frustrated by not understanding it, the level is much higher than the previous ones.

By the way, if you develop an interest in dynamic systems (chaos theory), this is definitely a conference that you will remember in the future.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Yeah, it really was that good of a lecture. Professor Strang's Immortal Lecture.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
"Calculus sucks" - Strang, 2005 😆

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
(65+41+70+90+58+82+76+78+59+59+84+89+134+51+72)/15 <> 67.5

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
41:42 answer should be 6/16, he forgets to color and count (2,1).

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
You are right there is no audience. They are so good, they shut up and just listen(it's a joke).

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you, MIT! And thank you for enabling comments! Free speech kicks ass!

### 34. Final Course Review
@[USERNAME]howd yah do on linear algebra final? i have to learn 100% in a week think im good?


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you Prof.Strang!! and obviously MIT too!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT, biggest name in leading edge technological schools... And they don't even have a white board? :-)

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am watching those right now.  And I completely agree with you.  He tries to cover the material rather than give students UNDERSTANDING :(  I am deeply disappointed by MIT.  I thought the level of teaching there will be superb but this Professor ( i am sure he knows math ) makes easy things obscure.  Unless you already know and understand material it is impossible to follow him.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
goood one

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
If there's only one thing to take away from Strang's lectures/lessons, it is this (which he emphasizes in one of his textbooks):


Understand in depth the four most fundamental subspaces: the row space, the nullspace, the column space, and the left nullspace.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really don't think tracing the teacher throughout the whole lecture was necessary...

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Watching 3b1b's series and then this one paints such a rich picture of the connections between the symbolic and geometric interpretations for these ideas. So fascinating to see the differences in their approach, yet so illuminating to piece together the equivalences and build a deeper conceptual understanding.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Anyone here, who took this class live in the classroom @MIT in 2005?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
They probably have 3 or 4 lecture each week, depending on the amount of credits the course is worth. Something like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I bet.

### 4. Counting
TY

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
@[USERNAME]

IM not 100% sure but my prof usually did things like this. He just used values that fit the condition so he could proceed.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
that accent would kill me

my dude... you said 0 + x = 0 for the additive identity... it should be 0 + x = x 😂

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This guy is great.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Yes, because "writing special erasable marker" expresses much stronger academic competence.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Another beautiful course with incredible supporting materials. Both Prof. Auroux and MIT did a great job on this one.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I admire this person a lot, it shows his passion and dedication. At his advanced age, I hope I have the same love at work as he does.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Genius

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
This lecture is definitely a positive effect on my grasp of the matrix, and this lecture plays a pivotal role in the whole series. Thank you prof. Strang.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Hey, the closed caption just disappear once the word is showed, It should continue to appear until the next word change. And audio and video is not sync either.

### 3. Independence
37.50 ??

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
At 43:54, if we exchange rows of A, what spaces will stay the same? I understand that row spaces won’t change since it’s row combinations but why would null space not be changed as well? Wouldn’t left bill space stay the same?

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
The first question from the problem set asks for the eigenvalues of A+ when A square. I know that A and A+ have the same number of zero eigenvalues but I'm stuck searching for a relationship for the non zero ones. Some hint?? I check numerically and I verified that they are not 1/λ_i as one might have conjecture.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Mit you do not have to use digitized voice system to make your point !!!

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
ugh, I hate trig substitutions

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]Right, b/c I'm sure most of this stuff is dopily obvious to him but he's trying to explain in step-by-step still. 

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
thanks for the video! Question: can someone explain the difference between big Sigma and S. One is covariance matrix, one is sample covariance matrix. they are not the same thing? Thanks!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i dont think this is what youtube was made for ._.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
bahut badiya

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
In the example x^2+y^2-z^2=4, why did the 4 disappear when he eventually wrote the equation of the plane? Shouldn't it be the constant 8+ the original 4?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lawls even on a lecture about implicit differentiation YouTube can't avoid moronic arguments, humanity <3

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
I've been waiting for this ever since I looked at Sipser's page and saw that it was being reviewed for OCW!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
America is such a great country they even put lectures by great proffesors on YouTube for free...in my country the professors pretend to be illiterate outside the colleges.,,,😅

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
he's a great professor. very rarely you see such a talented teacher in math.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
You just cannot miss anything Prof.Strang wrote on the board

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
God bless Dr. Strang!
There are Innumerable people in the STEM fields who owe their careers to stalwarts like him. A human treasure of knowledge!!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why the seats in the classroom are all empty

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Is anyone watching this in 2022?

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the analogy at 21:00. First time i got this :) 

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Professor Strang you are the first person who makes me deeply understand linear regression from linear algebra's point of view.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Why 6 dimensions for symmetric? We have 3 for main diagonal and that's all. Isnt it?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Maybe a faster way to do that integral is by parts taking u= (cosx)^3 and dv=cosx, shouldn't be hard to get that 2/3 integral of cosine to the 4 is equal to 2 times integral of cosine square! in that interval then use double angle fomula. But that's not the point of the lecture.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Me, a greek person watching the video, what the hell perpendicular means ? Thank god he said the word with the greek origin at first!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Εύχομαι κάθε δάσκαλος να είναι τόσο καλός όσο ο καθηγητής Γιάννης Τσιτσικλής!

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
What a great professor he is.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Can someone explain why A=LU is better than EA=U?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the formula for cos(x-y) is identical to the dot product of two vectors written in trigonometric form.  the formula for sin(x+y) is equal to a determinate with cosx, cosy in the first row and sinx, siny in the second row.
-
using the properties of even and odd functions, one can then get back and forth between sin(x-y) and cos(x+y);

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
He is working magic here in his lectures. I am experiencing one of those "math is beautiful" moments with these concepts and ways of thinking about matrices.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
09:22 guy gets the joke late, awkward laugh

in fact it is

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i would i've loved to go to this college. only if i lived in the USA. yikes

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
I just have one question not addressed in this lecture...what actual color is the blackboard?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Jeez that's a lot of homework

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's interesting that students of this clase all over the world have the same questions .... all of them about algebra

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
11:41
"Rows of C are combinations of rows of B."

But, this only works for square matrices, isn't it?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
19:08   No you dope!!!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
That smile at the end, he knew he'd done a good job

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
phew, my left ear had a hard time catching up

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Very useful for Montreal Polytechnic school where we use Gilbert Strang book, but we only missed his explanations, so I was referred here

### 18. Properties of Determinants
~22:10 "now I have to get serious"

so, what was all that other stuff?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
the whole lecture was incredible.
godlike.
gausslike.
stranglike..!!!!!!!!!!!!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4bDpTs5tRVdSQuPRn7Mv1g

Thank  you! Excellent!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Geart job Sir, Thanks

### 34. Final Course Review
I'm very appreciative to have this course. Thanks MIT and Professor Strang. I'm getting good at this with your help!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Points on the wheel do not have the same speed. Point of contact with the ground has 0 speed, the center has speed v, while the topmost point has speed 2v. By the time the centers moves some distance, the top point would have moved a greater distance. However if we fixate on a point on the rim, it will have variable speeds and would have covered various lengths in different time periods. The total length covered by one such point is arc length and it is more the circumference.

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
MIT should invent a better quality borad cleaner. Its hard to read the writngs on the board when it is cleaened.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
17:39 Why is abb rejected? From q3 it can transition to q4 using empty string, and the last 'b' can just be ignored.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
mathematics and chalk boards go together like proportional rates.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Excellent instructor but  poor hand writing.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Five minutes in and my mind is blown

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
The lecture is sooooo satisfying

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I did not understand at 30:15 he says there is a shortcut where look at the relative odds of these two events. how would this 'shortcut' work?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wasn't better to solve cone problem as following:we set infinit small volume dv=f(h)dhwhere f(h)=(pi) R^2,then we divide by dt then we plug in the values without the need to differenciate,because for such problem it happened to be easy to differnciate the function but sometimes it is not

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'm sure mit will be number one in the wold in future education

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]"And, lift-off."  LOL

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
49:04 Recalled an old meme 😂🤩

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
what prerequisite please???

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Are you a wizard? I'm telling the Ministry of Magic!

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lol, college is so much better with the internet.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like Prof. Jerison. 👍🏻

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
That was amazing and awe-inspiring. :)

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
What would the corresponding eigenvectors for -i and I at 41:00. Ther null space for the matrix is zero so are they the zero vector for both

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
After seeing some of these lectures and checking a couple of exams, I think MIT is actually not that difficult. The thing is they do have access to these awesome lectures and they're taught how to think. I'm positively sure that Calculus II and 18.06 are much more difficult in two universities I'm acquainted with than in MIT. However, they're taught how to think at MIT and most good universities just try to explore the limits of difficulty, rather than giving insights into thinking.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I got it

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
I think I spotted an error. To get a t statistic, we should use square root of n, not square root of (n-1)

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I love his explanations. My linear Algebra prof. will just give us definitions, state theorums, and prove them and if were lucky we'll get an example, but never a solid explanation.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Eagerly waiting for that =) Hope the business world will understand how important free education for all people is...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone know what text the professor uses?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
853,620 quit already. 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Outstanding lecture-June 12th 2019

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For those confused by this lecture, don't worry, you should be, it's no a failure of yours, it's a syllabus description mistake.

I'm happy I see these videos as a review for things I ALREADY LEARNED years ago, because obviously if I were first exposed to this lecture with the prerequisites the course mentions, it wouldn't have been possible to understand this lecture.

While the course specifies 18.02 as a prereq, and then immediately dismisses in its syllabus as not important, this lecture requires both 18.02 and 18.03, the latter is not mentioned at all in the syllabus.  Universities usually parallelize these kind of courses with the parallel requisites such as 18.03, but OCW does not hint that at their site or here.

While for me it was nice, I recognize that if you don't know diff. eqs this would not be possible for you to learn.  The good news is that you can skip 1 or two lectures and you'd be right back on track, as this is just a nice implementation demonstration, but does not block Lin. Alg. learning.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
why exactly is the null space of (A transpose )(A) = to the null space of A ?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
In 3D.
Ha. .. Ha.. Ha..

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
@15:16, I apologies.......................That's how a matchless, renowned and extraordinary person respect everyone, everywhere.
Love you Prof. Gilbert Strange:)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 23:31 the captions make a mistake, I think the professor meant: "in terms of expanding, factoring and so on", not vectoring..

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what the hell is this cross multiplying stuff with the quotient rule proof can someone explain his way from 1st to 2nd line :(

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Since for pi/4 it is part of a sphere, shouldn't the top be curve like the icecream on the top of the cone?

### 12. Time Complexity
There is no video for Lecture 13 as that was the day for the Midterm Exam.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Dr. Strang is precious, protect him at all costs.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A derivative is the slope of a line.  Like if the line is Y = 2X, the slope is 2, so Y=2 is the derivative of Y=2X.  A limit is basically what the graph looks like it is going to do as it gets closer and closer to the limiting value.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
"Lemme just do it the old fashioned way..."
blows my mind....

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks MIT really appreciate it...and this Professor is awesome...
those three people who disliked they must be next Albert Einstein

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This video repeatedly halts at about 20:00
I was hoping to catch the review which was about to begin here and then goo back to textbook problems,
also i can't seem to catch lecture 8 in my browser;  that's anothe hitch.

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
@ 15:02 could someone explain why Dr. Tsitsiklis got rid of the delta in the conditional probability?

Would be golden if  the explaination to that factorization came in.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Don't be put off by this massive piece of junk here."

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When you clear black board sir awesome

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love him yelling at that kid who asks the stupidest questions.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
The board work is terribly awesome..They challenge many of the standard vector calculus textbooks

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought these MIT wizards were meant to be the cream of the cream, how have they not come across the cosine rule yet? I'm not even out of high school and we've done far more complex stuff!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is amazing thanks MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Nice professor, nice teaching and nice school.

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
So you cannot go to a class you are not registered in MIT ? This is the first time I hear this thing...

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Zero X -- Zero interest 18:18

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
Doubt at Checkin 3.1 at 28:30 Shouldn't the answer be B as we showed in the last lecture how to convert NFAs to DFAs, just like that we have to show GNFAs to DFAs even if we assume the transitions to be a single symbol ?

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
19:28 since the fact that  Q transpose times Q equals identity matrix is true for all matrix with orthonomal columns, doesnt Q times Q transpose also equals I ? the P= I always holds true for matrix with orthonomal columns?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
love prof. Strang

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Rachei de rir: "... anybody below four is in trouble...."

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 36:30, why is it that moving from F'(x)=G'(x) to F(x)=G(x)+C uses MVT?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I think it's better to first watch the amazing TA Linan Chen video  then come back and watch this lecture

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is one fundamental thing wrong in this lecture.
It is not true that the integral of u'/u du = ln u + C. It has to be ln (abs(u)) + C. This means e.g. that the integral of sec x dx = ln (asb(sec x + tan x)) + C. The same error occurs in the final example about completing the square. The answer to that example also does not have the necessary absolute signs.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
does anyone know how to obtain the reading material for this class the book George F. Calculus with Analytic Geometry?

### 16. Markov Chains I
What a brilliant professor. This was so so helpful

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I absolutely love this teacher. Gauss thought of it because he was born before. And he died early. Really enjoyed and laughed about it. Amazing.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
i cant understand why b should be in the different combination  col. space in A.
could anyone helps me?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
الله يحرق اللينير

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I have never been this excited to watch a teacher's lecture. Thank you sir.

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
How many MIT courses are there with no videos, and Prof. Strang comes through with an incredibly relevant course with full course videos. Amazing.

### 34. Final Course Review
what an amazing course , just did not want it to end. been here since lecture 1.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what does "rangle" even mean? it is clearly a shorthand for rectangle

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i so badly want to write on that board with that piece of chalk :P it looks so nice to write with

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't get why it had to be a plane. at 36:30

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
least square problem: to solve a system of equations that has more equations than unknowns, i.e. non square matrix.
we solve by At Ax = At b, but since we cant find At for non square matrix, we approximate using svd

beautiful.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof. Strang!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I m here because of learning the mechanics of Fast Fourier Transofr

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture made me throw away my usual school textbooks and grab some on my own after searching around, which actually will push me through some rigorous explanations like these, instead of "take natural log and you will have answer" Which many does

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Even if God taught linear algebra, it wouldn't have been better than this.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:40 "exercise" is misspelled "excercise."

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Why are these stupid students not clapping at 24:13 ?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
markers use much more petroleum in their production than chalk... maybe it's environmental.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Oy, my textbook uses a much more complicated formula for det(A), glad to know the product of pivots shortcut.

### 12. Iterated Expectations
Which book sir ?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought they murdered the other prof for not remembering the sin sum formula :D

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he could prove better after squeeze theorem.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Can someone tell me what's the level of this course? Is it good for pre calculus? I just finished high school and I don't wanna fail in college (I'm going to CS) will this work for me?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
great thanks!!

### 15. Poisson Process II
Saw the last video? Skip to 11:40 👍

Smart people fascinate me

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Instructor: Gilbert Strang。

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Am I the only one who felt hard to follow the course? 6:31 means basically, using properties of variance, we have X bar as X_bar, the n observations of x are i.i.d. Bernoulli, Bernoulli's variance = E[x^2] - E[x]^2 = 1^2*p - 0^2*(1-p) - (1^2*p - 0^2*(1-p))^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p). Having this variance, we can derive the variance of X_bar, which is var(X_bar) = var([X1+...+Xn]/n), know properties of variance, we take n out, as var(X_bar) = 1/n^2 * var(X1+...+Xn), since i.i.d., these xi all have the same variance, therefore we have n*var(xi) divided by n^2, so the variance(X_bar) = var(Xi)/n, so to standardize it (in CTL), we divide it by the square root of var(Xi)/n, which is what he wrote on the board. So, it all roots back to Prof. Tsitsiklis' Probability course.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
on the book there is a part I did not get at all-namely starting"to display a circle on screen,replace y"=-y' with finite finite difference equation" from end of 315 page till 317,
anyone who has understood that part?

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
theorem: Expected value is linear operator

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Summary of this class , Since so many on comments are confused ->
Target -> Solve Ax=b / Ax=kx / Au=kv When A is big matrix.
**1)Finding Eigenvalues of Big Matrix ->
QR process ==> A0 -> Q0R0 , A1(SImilar to A0) ->R0Q0 = Q1R1 , A2 -> R1Q1=Q2R2 And Go on ultill we have a Upper Triangular Matrix 
QR process on original matrix will be expensive .First take the matrix to Hessenberg Form and then do QR process.
Take the Matrix A to Hessenberg form H using Arnoldi Iteration.
If The Matrix A is S(symmetric) Then , the hessenberg form will be tridiagonal And even easier to compute .

**2) Finding SVD ->
a)Find Q1 And Q2 such that Q1*A*Q2 becomes bidiagonal (The SIngular values will remain same since its unitary invariant)
b)Use some QR kind of method to find SVD from the bidiagonal Matrix 

**3)Solving Ax=b (Not on lecture but on Notes) ->
a)Use GMRES and get a answer on Krylov space
b)Use Conjugate Gradient if The Matrix A is Positive Definate

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

x approaching Xo = change in x approaching zero

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That's the joke idiot. 

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I don't see what's so good about Gilbert Strang. I'm only able to learn and understand part of the content with him and so much of it I can't keep track of it.

I forget what is an invertible matrix, he always seems to just say this is invertible by just looking at it, and I can't see it by just looking at it, so that makes that hard to follow.


I can't keep track of what has n, n - r, m - r, all that gets jumbled up in my mind.


He wants me to go through steps with him, and sometimes I don't even know where's going with it, so I can't, I have to wait to see what he does, probably because he hasn't shown the steps first along with why they work, so that it never synched in my brain to begin with.

Occasionally I am able to answer a question right when he asks, but half the time, I'm only half following, if even that.

I don't see why other people think his teaching style is so amazing, it's so scattered, and doesn't clearly show how & why things work before expecting me to follow along with examples.

Though I think I'm pretty good at doing elimination.

I definitely can't multiply matrixes so fast as he does, I need to pause the video, and actually write down my work on paper, he just skips steps and writes them down.

Like I don't get it, his style is just way off for me, do I just learn differently then most people?, like I don't get it.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
08:10 how do you express the plan formed by two lines in general?

### 17. Markov Chains II
I really like his lectures!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
For a minute I thought the lecture was being given by Jimmy Dore. He sure could make good use from some statistics lectures.

### 3. Independence
The instructor looks like the "Tom Yorke" of statistics to me!

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Love professor Casey. Can we get lectures of linear algebra, matrix algebra, complex analysis also?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
really like this teaching  method. give me new insight about  matrix

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Hi can I post your videos to my facebook page?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Use 1/2 angle identity to integrate at 20:20 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandyMcMillan/MAC2313/master/MITCalc3Lectures/WolframAlpha--intergral_sqrt_2_2cos_t___from_t_0_to_2pi___Definite_integral__2015_11_10_1124.png

### 15. Poisson Process II
Shouldn't the answer to the fish question at 15:46 be equal to p(0,2)*p(1,3) instead of p(0,2)*(1-p(0,3))
I say this because the fisherman should fish for no longer than 1 fish. In the case of 1-p(0,3), he's considering all the possibilities that he could fish 1,2,3,4,5,6,7..... any number of fishes during that interval? from hour 2....5

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very energetic teacher, handwriting is very clear and explanation is very satisfactory

junk = 1 over infinity maybe

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
PERSONAL NOTES
1. Say p = 60% from n samples. How many samples would it guarantee that p > 50%? We need a model for this. The goal for our model is that the density must be as narrow as possible (least possible volatility), and the value that we're looking for is as close as it is likely to be. Assumptions: random (good way to model lack of infos, otherwise non-math wouldd suffice), i.i.d,

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing moment at 4.10 or thereabouts when most of the students obviously thought it wasn't simply connected. I thought MIT students were supposed to be smart!

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When you help others you hurt youself? (with education, economy, etc..) Is that what your main concept is ?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I have a question regarding matrix multiplications. If I've got 3 matrices A, B and C where: AB=C
If B is invertible, is it true that A times B inverse = C?

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this was probably the most confusing lecture up till now ... so many crazy notations :(

no i think that is differential equations you single varible then multi variable then ODE and then if you like PDE partial differential equations but some places it might be calculus 3 different unis have different ways of doing the courses and different order

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
meanwhile in Brazil, public and private universities retain knowledge as if it belonged to them.... you are wrong, knowledge belongs to society.... this is the big difference between slavery and freedom.... long live the united states of America.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Is anyone else amazed at how he lets you see both the forest AND  the trees... Simply the most elegant exposition of mathematics I have ever seen...

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
Typing a response on Youtube is more like a conversation rather than writing a college dissertation, wouldn't you think? Yet, there are always people focusing on each and every details in an attempt to push out rethoric for some strange reason. Perhaps the need to ventilate, or express some frustration in their lives, who knows. So, gentlemen, please, let's keep our eyes on the ball, shall we?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
sorry....but really not sorry 38:32.  Thank you Gilbert Strang!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
In A=LU part, what do L and U stand for? (Like "E" for elimination )

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It took me about 40 days to finish this course. Thank you so much Prof. Auroux!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thank you MIT!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
good lecture


### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
These lectures are so good that I am falling in love with studies, specifically Linear algebra for the first time. I always dreaded the topic in my college days, just wish there was someone who could have referred me to these lectures back then.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
46 minutes. woah. can i haz crash course?

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Can we find homeworks/labs online?

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
1.25 speed helps

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Some time can be saved by not speaking out the rules about honesty etc. and instead handing out a link to the web file where the rules are spelt out in full.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
He keeps mentioning multiplication rule of probability here , but where did he teach that?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I AM COMING TO YOU TO LEARN MATHEMATICS FROM BASICS.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i feel like those writings are popping out of the black board.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
i didn't learn anything about linear algebra at my own university. then I found these lectures from MIT.

this stuff is GOLD!!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
first row       (2 and 1) multiply by 16 ( 32 and 16)
second row (3 and 1) multiply by -9  (-27 and  -9)
then add the two rows                         (   5 and   7)
(or subtract if you multiplied by 9)

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
This is the best explanation of exponential family i have ever come across.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
At 32:32 the expression is actually S*Lamdba^100*c, and not Lambda^100*S*c .

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Terrific, terrific lecture, esp his way of using linear combination / "column picture" to solve equations. I have never heard of it, but it is so much easier!  Thank you Prof. Strang/MIT for posting these lectures!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Охеренная лекция! Чувак рулит. Лучше, чем препы с мехмата объясняет!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well i like this blackboard thing.... and if i am ever going to teach i will keep this in mind... as a student or follower of the lesson...life is easier when things are written like this... it gives you the time to write down what's saying and also writing...the board goes up and stays there if u're slow..and he makes right at the time what he's explaining...it makes it understandable.A power point slide is always fast, done, and the person who's explaining, most of the time, just reads it.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform

Professor Strang, thank you!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
24:00

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The description said this lecture contains hyperbolic functions. I watched the whole thing in hope of facing Coshx and Sinhx, none were discussed! 

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Physicists insert a minus sign to get a nice looking energy conservation law: 

K + V = constant.

Without the minus sign, conservation of energy would look like this:

K - V = constant.

Here K is kinetic energy and V is the potential energy.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Listen with your headphones at the beginning, it would give you a classroom experience.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

He teaches vector in very easy way😀😍

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]why isn't it a 3-d subspace in R4? Shouldn't all the linear combinations of two independent vectors in R4 be a 3d plane?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
itülüler yeter diyordu davut hoca dinlemiyordu

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm relieved to see i haven't been the only student to come late to class.

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Why are there no lecture videos available for many courses? (e.g. Algebraic Geometry).

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
30:10 But only 3 needles cross the line?!?

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
DR. Strang thank you for linking linear algebra to real world technology. Circuit design and machine design uses linear algebra.  The development of Google uses linear algebra.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
15:37 "OH DAMN ... circle the wrong thing"

great professor .... mistakes happened to all

What a wonderful human, and must be excellent teacher as well.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
YES!!!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This professor is a legend.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i understood shit from this...im more confused 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really ? French students learned before the high school ! Is that a lesson for MIT engeneer?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
An alternative way of deriving the equation
 If we have Ax=b with no solution. lets say c is the best solution so that Ac=proj(b on C(A)). then Ac-b is orthogonal to Ac so that the dot product of Ac-b and Ac is zero. But that can be writing in matrix form as (Ac)^t(Ac-b)=0
c^tA^t(Ac-b)=0, c^t(A^tAc-A^tb)=0 since we don't want c to be zero c^t can't be zero. that means A^tAc-A^tb=0 or A^tAc=A^tb

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
42:34 can someone explain the probability question again pls?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great vid..keep the good work up pls

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
That man. Is a legend. My gratitude and respect to Prof. G. Strang.

### Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers
The norm is a real valued function, the range of the bounded linear functionals is the field of complex numbers.  In your demonstration of boundedness, you are comparing the size of a real number to a complex number, which doesn't make sense.  You need the magnitude of the complex number in front of the norm.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
美帥酷 正負零 神國人

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Really a great lecture. He explains things simply that they seem obvious. I had never learned it as clearly as this in my college.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why would I care about improving my English, it's my 4th language and I speak it well enough for anybody to understand my completely without a problem. Also, I'm not claiming to be extremely smart, I'm saying MIT sucks, $100k per year for an education you could have gotten by self-studying? No thank you. Besides, a lot of universities are above MIT's level of undergrad math. The IITs for example. This is a joke for them, primary school material. 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where do x(sub naught) and y(sub naught) go at 40:59? It may be a rudimentary question, but I've been out of math classes for a number of years now. I am able to follow along with all of this except that one piece, and it's bugging me. What did I forget?

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thats the easiest part of calc

math should test your logic/problem solving skills, not your memorization skills

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
why doe proffs banter about stupid shit just get to the point and save time for questions
they all seem to be like that

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
anyone else notice at 8:13 that he said "tre" y squared at first and then corrected himself? french people ftw. 

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
He is so lovely and fun

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
CORONA

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i was the little sister and I got a dart right between the eyes, up about a half inch.  probability is 1.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
what does support of P tetha means please?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
for the equation: (A- lanbda* I)* X = 0, why should (A- lambda*I) needs to be singular?

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
43:30 How can column space of Q be same as column space of A?? I know that their dimensions are same, but Q is composed with orthogonal vectos and A is not. I need some helps guys {{{(>_<)}}}

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I always thought that systems with less equations than unknowns might either have 0 or indefinitely many solutions. Dr. Strang, however, says that a system with 3 equations and 4 unknowns should have a solution (7:47). Am I not getting something?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
36:39 i think that the guy to the left is getting it xD

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah you can see it by his accent

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I can barely hesitate to say that these lectures are incomparable to the lectures I attend for Linear Algebra at university. It's uncanny how often when watching these videos I think, "I get it now, I get it!" Cudos to you Prof. Strang!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Jedna planéta od povedala napi sa vody aby si mohol lietať ďalej

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Why is it such a common spoonerism that he says "toin coss" instead of coin toss @25:16? I have the exact same issue when giving a lesson!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Well by the law of large numbers, delta method and Slutsky, I can hence say I am an idiot!

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where is Lecture 26 ? This is the 3rd lecture gone missing :-)

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does the range of y change for different values of x in the xy plane

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT using  Blackboard and chalk?? gotta step it up

facebook was built in 2004, this was recorded in 2005....i wonder if he knew this biggest application of graphs.....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Se ti vysypal čaj, nebo co? :-)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Came here to learn calculus.. got busy reading the comments.. Damn!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, this man explained everything what I had to learn in a 4 months in 30 minutes XD I'm 15 years old though.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I learned this in seventh grade. Seriously.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
The passion and curiosity to explore are still shining brightly in his eyes and haven't subsided even a bit. G. Strang is an inspiration and is one of those fewest mathematicians who is loved as much for a person that he is as he is loved and appreciated for the knowledge that he gifting the world. Love you, Professor. Live long and stay healthy. The Universe is with you.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof slaying that navy blue shirt.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thanks so much MIT, I majored in math in my first semester and changed into literature when I became a sophomore;) because I had so much trouble in understanding (qwq) Now in this class it suddenly comes to me maybe it’s not my problem but the teachers haha (I am self-studying programming now!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you! Mr. Strang.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
lol. I came here just for learning maxwell's equation 6 years ago. Physics sucks so badly compared to math. I do not need any "physics" explanation.

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
does the prove for intersection conserve convexity needs a premise that A and B needs to be convex?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
why the projection matrix that projects b onto N(A ^ T)  is I - P ? Can somebody please make me see that?

### 18. Markov Chains III
In the previous example, when we were at state 2, we directly took 0.2 as the probability to reach state 4. But here at 44:08, why are we using the u2 value?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
e in N(At) is perp. to C(A) just killed me. 30:30
How smooth can someone explain the "big picture" step by step over weeks.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
42:45 If A and B have the same four subspaces, then they have the same reduced row echelon form.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I LOVE how he realizes the concept of vector spaces is difficult for most people to understand!

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
I have found the solution of generalized S-M formula. I mean the solution of (A + u1*v1 + u2*v2 + u3*v3 + ... + uk*vk )^-1

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Thnks professor...

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Best lecture that explains intuition behind eigen values and eigen vectors. It's not just about cramming the formula.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Bookmark, random sampling of matrix 36:20

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
When talking about continuous random variables don't use the word random because there is nothing random about the distribution of the outcomes of these particular variables due to the nature of the samples being analyzed. Unfortunately this seems to be a misleading concept throughout almost all the videos on the internet regarding this subject. Even discrete random variables shouldn't initially be considered random due to the uncertainty of their distribution outcome. Uncertainty and randomness do not have the same meaning. An uncertain discrete variable could prove to be more likely random in it's outcome according to a more likely random type distribution.   When analyzing continuous variable distributions you're are admitting the existence of a value range (similar to a discrete distribution), but contrary to a discrete distribution you are also admitting that, without any trials and without knowing the outcome, that you are going to have a certain type of distribution that follows a certain type of symmetrical curve. As the values tend to get further from the peak of the curve their frequency starts to decrease more or less proportionally. It's almost like a rule that you follow. Being that the uncertainty lies only in the variance of the distribution. Normally dealing with continuous distributions you are analyzing co-related values (correlation between a infinite value and it's frequency), who's relationship is given through a formula. The problem is that there are no predefined rules, formulas or predefined co-relations for uncertain outcomes. Notice that I used the word uncertain and not random.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
some one said no that they had not seen the law of cosine. I mean...... how did they get into MIT?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
why are the vectors/edges of the cube not columns but rows suddenly ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm honored to have Dr Harrison Wells himself as my professor ... Genius mind...

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Did not quite understand @37:55, why we have three elements [ - - - ] in matrix size = 2 ,  Kindly help if someone understood

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
really appreciate him

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Am I the only one to believe "He" is the reason  Ross talks the way he does?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
oh god ! 7:03

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Good save, buddy.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
27:17 bottom left corner  that girl cracked his neck

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha yeah i thought the same thing after reading the first sentence. If he/she is able to hold such amount of information, surely he should have grasped that 'extreme autism' isnt a medical condition? Theirs no doubt in my mind he watches way to much (big bang theory)

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:11 Or am I
           -Michael from vsauce

### 20. Central Limit Theorem
One of my students suggested a short cut to calculate probability P(Z>2) without using 1-P(Z<2) rule. If we flip the inequality sign and the sign of the z value, we always get the same answer in one step. In this particular case, P(Z>2) is equal to P(Z<-2) and the answer we can directly read from the Standard Normal Distribution table (for the z=-2 value). 

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I guess this course was prepared for engineers, not mathematicians or scientists ;-)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone else most thrilled about the quality of their chalkboards?

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Best lecture ever!!!! I learned a lot! thank you professor Rigollet! Thank you MIT!!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 46:26, when he calculated the minors, the number at 2nd row 3rd column should be -2 instead of -1.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
He might correct it later, but as I am watching it:
I'm afraid Prof. Strang made a tiny error (pun not intended) at about 12:00. According to my understanding the right-hand side of the equation should be (1 2 2)^T not (1 2 3)^T. Can anyone confirm this?
Awesome lecture nevertheless.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"accent this" "accent that", I'm not even a native speaker, my english is very basic and I can understand this guy just fine... why are you americans complaining?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Best explanation EVER.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
The fall from 2M views lecture one to 18k views lecture 17 (half way through) is crazy. Congratulations if you're still here. I've followed every lecture so far (notes and all) and I've gotta say, it is 100% worth my time. I might not have a degree from MIT, but I can say I've experienced how superb their education is firsthand. Thank you to Professor G. Strang and MIT OCW for making these lectures available online. You have made learning for me interesting again.

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For the last part, why is it (right - left)? It is because the Method 2, setting the limit section on y-axis and evaluating the change of x-axis. That means (y+2)-(y^2) = dx.   

From the x-axis perspective, the x value from straight line (x=y+2) is definitely greater than the  x value from Arc BC (x=y^2). 

Or you can just simply draw a line e.g. y=1(horizontal line).  You will know the x value from straight line> x value from Arc BC

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guys is crazy with that chalk

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
this guy is such a joy to watch. his passion is contagious. love this guy

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
"The students have to think with the teacher... you can't just zip through a proof". This is such an essential part of teaching and learning and I am constantly amazed by how many professors have not realized this simple wisdom. Prof Strang is great.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why aren't they giving a meaningful description of what a derivative is in plain English? E.g. The derivative of a function is the function that evaluates to the rate of change for a given input.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well, the professor has a point when he say's "you should have a question". Nobody has any questions in these lectures, typically a sign that around 2/3 don't understand what's happening. I agree that the professor IS brilliant, but maybe a little too much so...you always feel clever when you watch clever people do their thing. Quality lectures though....

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
very nice  ....Thanks

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
In high school and I already know this... Get on my level MIT!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Same comment as everyone else. This was a much better explanation than my professor gave. 

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
"the origin of the world is right here"

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very helpful

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
@[USERNAME]singular matrices take some non zero vector x to zero and there is no way A inverse can recover it, that's why A inverse does not exist. great explanation.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
these lectures are great! thank you, MIT!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Am I watched the previous lecture 🤔🤔

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
26:33 DENIEEEEDDD.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Dr Rodriguez is an absolute Top G. My man dropped the Real Analysis course (which I'm still devouring) a few months ago.

This was long awaited.

Thank Prof!

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
The instructor is a genius. Look at his CV.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
these lectures are awesome, but as someone who didn't know anything about linear algebra, i DEFINITELY suggest watching these  videos by 3blue1brown instead or first, depending on amount of time avaliable: 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

One actually understands what "matrix multiplication is a composition of linear transformations" means and why that is really all one needs to know in order to truly understand matrix properties and operations (instead of just memorizing them).

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
32:56 Thank you Prof. Strang.

it will make sense if you say what I just wrote...
you CAN NOT bring -Xo over the other side since  --> is not >
DUH.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you for providing this for free.
but pls don't write down all you said on blackboard, it's boring. 50minutes content, 40 of them are waiting to finish writing.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
He's got such a lovely piece-by-piece, jigsaw-building lecturing style, as if he is rediscovering and rebuilding the knowledge in front of us

to be clear: i understand the product rule and 'ax^a-1', but i'm confused about where the primes are coming from.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor, you have done extremely well. The sum of   the first n squares is worth mentioning, given these students will study real analysis, soon. You have set everything up for clear understanding.Cheers.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man, I miss calculus! So good to see these lectures!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The world need more professors like you sir.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I agree, the differences between my high school teachers and these professors in terms of what you can learn in, say, an hour is pretty scary!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great, thank you

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT Lecture? Really??? Here in the UK we did all this - and more - at age 15 or 16. You Americans would be LOST at any decent UK University. As for trying Oxford or Cambridge - good luck, is all I can say....

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
It appears that I may have to purchase the course text. I thought that I might get by without it.  Has anyone had success without the text? The lectures are pretty good.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Wonderful! Thank you, Professor Gilbert Strang!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Professor Gilbert Strang ! 
I read your calculus book in highschool and it was awesome.
I didn't get into high end institutes in India, but it sure taught me a lot.

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy always starts the topic mentioned in the video title towards the end and then teaches the majority of it in the next video, whose title is something else.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
mvp

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
At 43.15 how does he know that the constants are a11 etc?? Can someone explain me? I know this works but I can't understand why does it works

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Haha why do all linear algebra professors make mistakes by producing random numbers. Their minds are too sophisticated for my comprehension. :P

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you dont have to be intrested, if you are capable of undertanding this then you would take the exams get the qualifications and the better job

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Seriously the best thing that I could have found on the Internet. Too bad my final is in 4 days. Naturally I will be staying on youtube for quite a few hours this week

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow this is amazing, thanks MIT for the MITOPENCOURSEWARE .

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i saw this in vectorial geo.. it is so cool!! i like it!!

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
@[USERNAME]  mr + nr - r^2  =  mn - (m-r)(n-r)   makes sense as all (mn) parameters of A less a redundant bit due to the low rank.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Math is soooooo beautiful!

### 13. Bernoulli Process
The verbal proof given at 46:22 seems to be fallible. Doesn't it argue for full mutual independence from pairwise independence?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
That formula for 3 X 3s looks very different than the one I learnt with cofactors all in row one and their corresponding "minors", the dot product that is and with the middle term negated.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Glad to see you back

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
so nice of Prof. Gilbert Strang

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is guy loves writing on the chalk board!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Why line is called a line?
Because it's "line"ar 5:50;

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Now I can finally prove those spacial geometry formulas that I saw at school but couldn't prove because I didn't know calculus

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:00 where did he get 1/18(u^6) from?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
clearly MIT is toppest university in the 2012

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof. Strang, you're the best teacher!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
24:44   system:  2a+3b=5  ,  1a+1b=7  solution:  a=16 , b=-9

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
As of lecture #2, worst series in OCW I've found. Quality has skydropped since 18.01, what is it with European lecturers? Feeling the right way of teaching lies in proving complicate statements while defining nonintuitive math objects at uneasy peace rather than providing insightful examples, even tho this is just necessary ground knowledge and not the course core; and at the end of the day you can't even figure out how to solve problems from recitations. God I want Jerison back.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
truly brilliant and impeccably clear

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Thanks to him! I passed Linear Algebra.. I watched his videos for 4 days before final exam and I got 74 from final.. If I couldnt watch Dr.Strang's lectures, I would probably fail...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]The author of the textbook.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Whole Class Is empty ...
Even though He Lectured in such a way that Class is full of students
Awesome

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
28:00 Was it rotated to wrong direction? For example, if x = [0,1]^T, then AX = [1, 0]. So it is clockwise 90 degree rotation.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
How could I plug the UtU after sigma although they don't satisfy multiplication conditions concerning the size of matrices?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
I thought A^{T} A is positive semidefinite isn't it?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
does anyone know which book is he talking about?i mean in whole course he said its in the book??

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
w 4 kolumnie bład rachunkowy?????

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It's such an amazing video. He made me know the real meaning of matrices, not just use it to compute

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The the French have a huge background in math, hence being some of the top guys in Finance. What's everyone whining about?

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
Thank you Gilbert!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Wish I had a chance to meet you!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I hope the mic is not very sensitive otherwise I'd be angry to see nobody replying to the professor's questions!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
we only live so long....:-)'


### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
bro IIT's are nice.. I'm not gonna deny that but don't even bother comparing it to MIT. Any student in IIT is ready to give up their seat to get into MIT. If you ask an IIT student where do you want to study MIT vs IIT. What percent of students do you think will pick IIT if money is not an issue? You're paying for the quality of the educations and the opportunities. You are literally learning the from the BEST people possible. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
He is amusing.. Keeps the lecture interesting

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank You, Sir!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I love  it

### 34. Final Course Review
Mmm that last problem: that 3x2 matrix multiplies with the zero matrix [0,0] does not result in another zero matrix?!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he's so worried and messing it up while moving forward to next piece of the content

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
"Don't all speak at once", haha

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
at 32:35 => Should not the first cost be 99*2 instead of 100^2 because there are 99 rows below first one. For pivoting each row below, you need to multiply the first row by some constant then subtract from the row you are pivoting. So, essentially are we not ending up having 2 operations per row for those 99 rows, hence, 99*2 instead of 100^2 ???

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
why i can't watch it?

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Blackhole as singular has failed the singularity theory rather represent an unsteady conditions vaporises and disappeares into space cheating markov matrics of singularity.This really is a hats off to Einstein who predicted that Blackhole forming a singularity was not acceptable to him.Whether Hon.Rogen Penrose will explain this?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Good job! I recently uploaded a video in which I solve in detail an 
exercise with eigenvalues and eigenvectors:     
https://youtu.be/5KGBNkYIBTc

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
43:28
Strang sensei thinks student makes a mistake

Strang sensei : *Death*

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
does anyone have solutions to the problem sets on ocw?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
as long as your expectations are average about life, you will do fine with statistics.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]good i like the the spirit.I'am 27 and would like to learn math from the scratch!!.Are you on twitter by the way?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love and appreciate this. But I am going to use it to help me go to sleep. 

### 34. Final Course Review
Taught the subject with such simplicity :-) Thank You Professor Strang for helping me finish. Has given me the courage to explore the subject further.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Professor Strang! Thanks MIT OCW!

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Great professor changed his shirt

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
4:28 God, isn' it false ? Shouldn't it be  x = 1 and y = 2 ? Y is okay but x = -1 doesn't seem correct

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Anyone else want to hug him so much?

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
A "random variable is a function in programming".... mic drop!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am 16 and I learn it at school in Australia.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is the textbook used for this course?  It would be a help to supplement the lecture.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Truly amazing teaching skills. I want to see how well he would have explained it given more time.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you. Prof. Strang.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
His goal is to find the derivative of ln x which is w. At that case, derivative of ln x is unknown but can be found by using the fact that we know the derivative of e^x (which he found earlier). By taking exponential, he gets rid of the lnx whose derivative is not known and applies chain rule to find d ln x/ dx.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I Really Like The Video Projection Matrices and Least Squares From Your

### 16. Markov Chains I
16:20 This phrase was inspiring.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Someone know what linear algebra book  use in MIT?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Why can free variables take any value? I understood how to identify a free variable(column without pivot) but what does it mean for a variable to be free?

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Thanks thanks a lot

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thank a lot Vector spaces

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I just repeated watching this video twice and then got the idea of why L is better than E. Thanks Dr. Strang

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i found a similar proof for the derivative of trigonometric functions. to prove sinx/x=1 we can imagine that as x----->0, the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse approaches zero, but so does x. since they both because infintesimally small, but not exactly zero. their quotient should equal 1 right? 

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
a big thanks tothis prof for his efforts to give us cours about linear algebra


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mafia Mob moment at 11:36

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]they've taken trig already. they know about vectors (thats when we learn them in florida). maybe not so much about cross and dot products. I wouldnt expect them to know any good algebra but at least component addition and the basics. i had a good trig teacher in high school and i was exposed to dot and cross products. 

### 15. Poisson Process II
the bus arrival example is great after its further intuitive explanation, thanks.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Not as many comments. Did we lose some ppl somewhere???

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
link to lecture notes https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-5-discrete-variables-probability-expectations/MIT6_041F10_L05.pdf

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
mathematical language is everywhere same so
people may have easy relationship

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Interesting fact: Almost everyone thinks this is easy never gets close chance into  MIT, so are their academic achievements.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I read something on SVD without even knowing about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then watch a youtube video, explaining that V is actually the eigenvector decomposition of A^TA. Which is extremely insane when I got to see this video oh my godness. Now even haven't watched your SVD lecture, I can even tell the precise concept of it. Oh my godness Math is so perfect!!

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
This one was really good on probability

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Can anyone please tell me how always sigma1 > sigma2 > ... sigma_r ?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
30:57 "Matlab will do it, but it will complain" what a humour xd

### 18. Roth's theorem I: Fourier analytic proof over finite field
Ap gzb pada rahe hai

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
in 47:38 what's the point of limiting the boundaries of the integral to exclude zero regions? wouldn't integrating over those areas (over the entire x) just "add" zeroes, thus yielding the same result?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
people in the comments really tryna get into mit

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
"so anytime I'm multiplying cofactors by numbers I think I'm getting the determinant of something"

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I am lucky to have the teacher that explained us linear regression THAT VERY WAY! :D

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:!2 NEWTON'S METHOD

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Definitely Dutch, I'm thinking German. That's a fairly strong Germanian sounding accent.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
at 42:48 he says he will tell us how to get from A to U and then says there's a better way - get from U to A but goes off on a tangent and runs out of time. Anyone know a summary of where he was going with that?

### 4. Counting
Really simplified! Thank you!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Don't forget another great thing about MIT. MIT does thing like share these lectures.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I <3 MIT ^_^

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Why are free variables chosen for assuming 0 & 1 to solve the equation, why not pivot. If I do, I am getting a different null space & its valid null space.Can someone help to understand why only free variables are chosen why cant we continue with same process with pivot variables to be 0&1 and hence obtain more solutions

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
If X is in [0, d/2] we shouldn't be counting the paper clips outside two lines, right?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Where would we be without Descartes??











                        Nowhere

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
46:17 I think row 2 would then become 0 1 0 and not 3 1 0 as the professor wrote down on the board.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Intellectually stimulating and after just one drink you really hear the humor of this guy ... small example 44.10 ... "I guess I am giving you infinitely many possibilities so I can't expect a unanimous answer" ... LOL

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
So all these concepts are taught in my college course, but they don't really tell how different topics are related. Then come exams, where you are supposed to link everything together on your own. I think this is why Dr. Strang's lectures are special!

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
The best of the bests

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
The first lecture was not recorded. We are hoping to record it when the course is taught again in the Fall.  In the meantime, please check out the course site here http://ocw.mit.edu/18-650F16 where you will find the slides that were used in all of the lectures.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you Dr. Gilbert Strang. I am a senior lecturer at Azerbaijan State Agrarian University. I teach the subject Linear Algebrain in English . You explain very clearly.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
God bless MIT! Thank you very much!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lectures are much more interesting if you ponder about them beforehand. Thinking on your free time gets you asking more questions during the lecture.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The pentagon cash isn't budgeted for stuff like this.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@[USERNAME]Yes, some lecturers become so used to their courses that they start to forget what it is that is considered difficult by new students, and stupidly assume that "everyone" "just knows" what all math symbols and proofs mean.
In my opinion, the best way to teach a new concept is to give a quick summary of what it is going to be about and then give a lot of examples, and encourage the students to help solving them.
That's exactly what professor Strang always does, and that's one of the reasons why he is so amazing.

I also think that it is very important that a lecturer shows a genuine fascination for the subject, and is always willing to help the students and respects that some of them may have a harder time than others with certain parts;
and it is also a huge plus if the lecturer has a sense of humour and presents the lecturers in a relaxed way.
And Strang seems to have all of these qualities as well.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love MIT. I will study there one day.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Very nice thank you.

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
uspset now lol

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
at [46:30], he first said that the derivative of  Rayleigh's quotient at the saddle points are zero, and it sounds like to me that he was recorrecting it by the eigenvectors, and how the values of the R(x) would be the eigenvalues. Can anybody shade some light? Thanks in advance.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
mit has high quality of blackboard

### 13. Bernoulli Process
this is how you read a lecture, thank you sir.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The captions are off just enough to be annoying. :P Great set of lectures, though!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]cum on.. 
you learn it, but im sure you don't understand the whole thing about it.. lolz
high school level of teaching and college is different.. FTW? ^_^

### 34. Final Course Review
I hope everybody who get something good from OCW could give back to it in some day anytime if you feel good, making it better and better as we can do and helping more and more people feel good like us, thanks.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
10:56 - Could someone explain this? I didn't get the derivative.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I really respect Prof. Gilbert Strang!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Where are the labs? They are mentioned in the syllabus, but are not in the OCW material.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
I've finished this course a while ago. still, going through Markov chains in probability was confusing till I came back and watched this, and again, Mr Strang came to the rescue.
I don't know how much I need to thank you for your online courses for it to be enough, as simply saying thank you doesn't do you justice. I just want to say that you, Mr Strang is one of a minority of people who indeed make this world a better place.
Thank you, from some corner of this Earth.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I've learned this first hand; the only difference between going to let's say MIT, and a state university; is the name of where you got your degree. My cousin, who lectures at Stanford once every two weeks for a multi variable calculus class, has noticed that the class is using the same book as I am.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did he deduce that (A-B).(A-B) equals (|A|^2+|B|^2-2A.B) without expanding?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished the whole Single Variable Calculus course.
Thank you MIT OCW for making this possible.
Chile, 2019.


-One thing to rule them all
One thing to find them
One thing to bring them all
And in a matrix bind them-

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:24 This clarifies the difference between Examples 2 and 3. Just shows how unintuitive some probability problems can be.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is phenomenal.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thanks a lot


### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So f"x is a weird Math's rollercoaster

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
28:43 A small mistake here. These three vectors are not the basis.
(-v1 + 2v2 - v3=0)

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
i'm sorry but what properties make the initial split (around 4:00) possible?

linearity says  that 

det 

a+a'  b+b'
c  d 

equals det

a  b
c  d 

plus det

a'  b'
c  d


or yet that you can factor a scalar out of a row in a way that

det

ta  tb
c   d

becomes

t * det

a  b
c  d





and I don't see how this makes it possible to split 

det
a  b
c  d

into det

a  0
c  d

plus det

0  b
c  d


am i missing something?

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
does anyone know what textbook they use for this course?

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He says fxy = fyx , that's assuming both fxy and fyx are continuous

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great!!!! (💝💝💝)^∞

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
have been waiting for his functional analysis for a long time!!! 😃Thank you!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This is a 90-degree chapter, Strang meant business from the word go!

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
@ 26:04 I have to admit, that took me a second to figure it out. 
Prof Strang didn't actually have anything wrong, he just couldn't see while in the middle of it why that was the case. He actually had it at 26:44 but let it slip through his hands.
For that you have to go back to when he was computing matrix "V".  The evec associated with eval of 18 was [1;-1] but it also can be written as [-1;1]

He chose the [1;-1] which had the effect once we made it to the final calculation of U * Diag^2 * V^t that it SWAPPED THE COLUMNS of A
His original A was [4,4;-3,3] and the calc'd one was [4,4;3,-3]
Had he chosen the 'other version' of the evec associated with Lambda = 18 when figuring out "V", he would have gotten back the same "A" he started with instead of the column-swapped version.
But what could go wrong? :-)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
K.

Can I have my hat now, please?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really love this course and the professor. Save my life!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
F prime is not Newtons notation for dervative. Newtons notation was a dot on top of the y variable.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Are there the seniors who took this course in their early under graduation courses .and  this has seemed very much helpful for them now ????

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I watched Probability for Life Science, Lecture 1, Math 3C, UCLA, it's a very good class as well. Those of you who loves Prob and Stats, you should watch too

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the cilynder oriantaion of C and C ' are opposite

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
38:30 closed caption is wrong. It is "discrete" not "discreet."

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
he finally broke character and laughed on the blackboard cleaning trick.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
i lost my mind when he taught about FFT. Anyway, Prof Gil. Strang is brilliant.

That's so unfair he says at 10:40 ish that they get all the formulas on the exam!! WTF we have to memorize ALL the stupid formulas

### 15. Poisson Process II
Dang - Prof Tsitsiklis is good! Reminds me of Gilbert Strang and Walter Lewin. Probably all MIT profs are good, eh?

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
15:02 i couldn't find c for the projection matrix

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
The brilliant series of lectures. However, this seems unclear one. I failed to understand the A derivation. What the system of equation does? Can you explain what Gilbert wanted to say? Wikipedia meantime does it trivially: A=[T(v1) T(v2) ..T (vn)]. 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how can i get this lecture's  textbook??  pdf or something

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
look

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The parabola doesn't matter in terms of bounds because we know it becomes the unit circle in the xy plane. The double integral cares only about the xy plane, and so that's all you need to know in order to set up the integral.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lecture. Thank you for sharing!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I wish I was smart enough to understand what the fuck this guy is talking about.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's in the beginning of the video. 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A text that will be suffiecient (if spelled correctly) for this course is CALCULUS
FOR ENGINEERS by DONALD TRIM
from university of manitoba. The course here in the hebrew university is too much hard, because they included logic, group theorem, induction and fields and computing methods first as a preview :(
good luck MIT anyway! :)

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Cool. He offers another direction here different from the book he wrote.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]all the best mate, because its extremely hard to get into MIT even with A++ all round

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Genius of this Man is the way he is explaining such a difficult concept so easily..... Hatts Off. As per Indian Ethos I just want to touch your feet.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
You are lovely Dear Professor.
Thank you very much.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about (I just simply suck at math + I'm not that advanced) but the way he teaches it makes me curious about it and also wish I knew how to do math like that.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just Completed the entire course. Multivariable Calculus was always on my mind since  my high school days. It was everywhere in electromagnetism, however somehow our teachers got away with 2D versions and some mischief, was just fine. Afterwards I went into Computer Science and never got chance to learn it. I always loved physics, however not knowing vector calculus was embarrassing, it was literally everywhere. Then I decided to do it this summer. Hats off to Professor Auroux, he teaches so smoothly never during the entire course I felt like once I feared it. It was so smooth (plus his board work! you will see what I mean when you take the course :)). I feel so much happy now, Thank you Professor Auroux and MIT for bringing us this wonderful course.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
would be nice if he related d/dx ln u that he uses to the method taught in the book. Makes things confusing and synthetically hard.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
16:55 There was a joke that we didn't get to hear :(

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Amazing. Think about it, xparticular plus the nullspace gives final x in r4, is the same as y=a*x+b in r2! This really blows your mind. Great class

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Excellent lecture from an excellent instructor

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
perfect.   God bless you...

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I like the the way you are analyzing the questions

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Mark: I skip this lecture.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Brilliant

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is extremely non-standard: the video starts with Professor Strang having already written his material on the blackboard.
We do not get to see the back of his head bobbing up and down as he spends half the video's time writing laboriously on the board. 
Who permitted this?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Sen nasıl  bir kralsın yaa.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I am kind of confused about the y=Ce=CAx  in this lecture. How we can draw this conclusion from the process of resolving the equation instead of relying on the physical explanation?

### Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums
thanks for uploading

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
41:52 -- LOL  (I'm officially a math-geek.  Then again, it's a calm, late-summertime Saturday Morning high in the Rocky Mountains and I'm watching this.  The conclusion was a bit forgone.)  Regrettably, way back in the day,  my fundamental default position was that all concepts were derivative and that prior to use their source must be known.  Here's how I wish a trusted mentor would have advised me regarding Linear Algebra in my third college semester: "The core things of linear algebra have been completely made-up and have only subsequently been discovered to have very interesting properties and to be extremely powerful (but only under certain conditions.)  Linear is mostly a short-hand notation for some stuff with which you are already familiar -- systems of linear equations. (Demanding to know the legitimacy of this new symbology is nonsensical.  It's very much equivalent to demanding to know why the utterance 'dog' is used to express the concept of a canine.  Worse -- it's like trying to derive the significance of the 'og' part of that particulate word.)  The core things of linear algebra are merely tools -- or better yet: heavy machinery.  They allow mathematical professionals (of the type you seem to aspire to be)  to 'move around', or to think in broad terms, about vast quantities of calculations that you have become expert at doing manually.  As with any scientific concept, their perfection is provisional.  Rest assured though, that they have been studied extensively for many centuries.  What they're good for, how they can be worked with, and where they fail are are all reasonably well known (as an example from today: Associative works; Commutative does not.)  Many people find linear algebra very useful.   Now, before this get's out of hand, let me first say that you are absolutely not 'many people.'  Further, I fully understand that trust and acceptance and taking-the-easy-way-out and group-think all scare the livin'-be-jesus out of ya. So I'm not asking that trust me and study linear because I know that it's right (we've already established that I don't), nor that you go-along-to-get-along, nor that you buckle down and learn this because it's what everyone else is doing.  What I'm offering here, for your consideration, is that the baubles you'll pick up from mastering linear will likely give you a really nice view of the mathematical world -- and I'm pretty sure you'll like that.  Have fun!"

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Don't feel too akward professor, there are people actually listening on the other side, maybe even more eagerly than some of the students that get to be there in person.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Although I have learnt Linear Algebra in last semester, Still feeling refreshed and amazed watching these lectures, Dr. Strang's teaching skill is sooo good!!!

### 3. Independence
People like this prof are a rare breed. Brilliant and yet able to articulate in a manner that everyone can understand. Thanks, MIT!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love this professor's lectures on this topic. He has explained one of the most complex concepts in vector calc in a very simple way!thank you

### 14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility
Why aren't there black cs professors?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thanks for opencaourseware that we can learn from this legend of Linear Algebra....

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I Really Like The Video From Your Differential Equations and exp(At)

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Single Variable Calculus?  Multi-Variable Calculus?  Can't we just say Calc 1, Calc 2, or Calc 3 instead of coming up with fancy names?

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
It is worth pointing out that A in the the notation N(A) (16:00) is a generic reference to matrix, not the Markov matrix used as a concrete example. Clarify this confusion, and we could better understand why the eigenvector of eigenvalue 1 is in the null space of ‘A’.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
1:13:56 I am not sure why c has to be greater or equal to -1.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pls Can Anybody answer me Where is Lecture 8 ??!!!!!!!!!!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Warm wishes, traveler.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Is this the only lecture of the series in which he wears a different colored shirt (sky blue in rest all)😉?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
it is a fortune to have these videos. thank you

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
He is probably the worst professor I ever saw to be completely honest.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I started off just wanting to pick up a few tips for 3D graphics.. dipping in .. and then this truly wonderful man drew me in. This is not mere teaching. It's sharing understanding, and the lectures are often the *exploration* of understanding. Thank you so much, prof. And thanks to  MIT, for sharing you with the world.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank's this is a good help for me, I have test of Differential calculus soon

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
22:47 - "Think of a solution, then figure out what b turns out to be." I see what you did there, very clever.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
last lecture . awesome lecture.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
"what b turns out to be...right! " 😀

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I was kinda lost through this video, wondering why he was calculating dimensions of the four subspaces of this graph matrix, while also guessing why he chose the edge matrix A the way he did(As a CS student I'm used to seeing graph in a different way). Then literally at the final minute he explained how the transformation worked and I was overjoyed for having an epiphany. I love linear algebra now.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I can hear quite fine on this lecture but not lecture 1. Very strange.

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
For BPP, deep learning and for the general structure of neural networks the following comments may be useful. 

To begin with, note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

It is also possible to look at the networks in a more structured manner. The basic ideas of BPP can then be applied in much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did you figure out inverse cosine of 1/root10 before hand...or do you have a trick you used to figure it out immediately?

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Fantastically succinct with a pinch, sprinkle if you will, of humor. This coupled with the high contrast between the chalk and chalkboard makes for a well-needed lecture. Very few professors can make me prefer lecture to just reading on my own, ADHD here. THANK YOU MIT!!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
My left ear feels grateful...

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yes

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Whenever he wipes the board I get SOOO excited...

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Any intuition for the rank to be n-1 ??

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For more intuition about the Green's Theorem, can it be thought of as- the potential energy stored in the rotational motion stored in the line integral of the closed curve is sum of the potential at the area inside curve, sort of like if you start twisting a rubber sheet, you get the work done on the closed curve when the rotation propagates radially outwards-building up from the work done on the closed curves of increasing radius?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 15. NP-Completeness
Just for clarity, for the 3SAT to CLIQUE conversion, the vertices of the graph are not the unique literals themselves, but rather for each clause in the formula there must be one vertex for each one of its literals. So formally, the vertices can be seen as ordered pairs (n,X), where n indicates a clause of the formula and X indicates one of its literals. Then the construction is that vertices (n,X) and (m,Y) are connected by an edge if and only if n≠m and the truth of X is consistent with the truth of Y.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank You, Professor Strang.
You are an awesome and an inspirational teacher.
I enjoyed this course very much.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
he is so dam good at explaning! I love him!!!!!!!!!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is that course for freshman year students?

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
The "idea" of orthogonal projection allowed me to understand the Christoffel symbols. I "studied" all the lectures on MIT 18.06 but I am still discovering the linear algebra anew. Thanks G.S. , thanks MIT.

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
Thank you so much. I'm extremely grateful to be living in a time where this much knowledge is so accessible. I'll try my best to support this content :)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Legendary. No other words. And I’m only 5 lectures in! Can’t wait for more. Thank you to everyone involved in making MIT courses so available!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I came here to fall asleep ended up learning a lot.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Long long time ago, almost failing in math classes, I came across Prof. Strang's linear algebra course. Now doing a PhD in machine learning focusing on stochastic optimization.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
How do you prove the single row linearity of a determinant, I mean how is in matrix A + matrix B we sum ALL rows but in det(A) + det(B) we don't?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Strang is great, Youtube needs improvement... we need a speed between 1.5 & 1.75

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Take a drink everytime he AUMM

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
1:13:20, when the professor is pointing to the slide, the camera should better point to the slide, too.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did he say "i'll meet you tommorroww @2:00am"??
DAMN!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much MIT!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Newton's method starts at 41:10 if anyone else is looking for that.

Good lecture :}

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
There's one video on Khan academy multivariable calculus talking about this, didn't quite get it. Now after his explanation, I finally know what is that.XD

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
David Jerison is a condescending asshole. I looked up one of the midterms in the OCW for fun and it says at beginning or end after test “congratulate yourself by basking in your superiority as you wait for the others to catch up” or something along those lines. It is no wonder some MIT graduates have insufferable egos. Check the courseware yourself if you don’t believe me. His talk about calculus being under appreciated just reeks of a passive aggressive superiority inferiority complex.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 02:10, in the denominator, why is the total circumference 2*pi ? Shouldnt it be 2*pi*a ?? I would suggest that since the radius is "a" and not 1? But appearently im wrong? Someone explain!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Today I have statrted this course. This is really awesome. I just want to know which book I should follow for this course?

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Professor Strang thank you for explaining the Orhonormal Column's in Linear Algebra. These topics are important for a solid building blocks in advanced mathematics.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
There is a mistake at 38:53.  It should be E[alpha] = alpha.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How would you get that?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I love this GrandPa - I really do - I hope someone closer to him let him know (I am in South Africa)

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
@[USERNAME]So you are saying is that the graph with no loops he drew at about 38:00 is not a tree? He didn't give any definition, he said "A tree is the name for a graph with no loops" meaning that a graph with no loops is a tree, which is absolutely correct, no matter how you look at it! You certainly don't need any degrees to see that ;)

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
My best professor !!!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow,there are lots of math geniuses making comments.Just enjoy the lesson dumb fuckers.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I think I am getting the point of linear equations. Almost thirty Years after I should have gotten it.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Anyone else get annoyed at the students walking in late? "You are blowing it, kid!"

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
He is so slowly teaching, but is a wonderfull teacher.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Perfect

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very good. Thank you. But in the first example at min. 29:30 , why you go (-1) in the " X "direction ? I think it's (+1) , so the Vector will be < 1, 1, 0  >.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
27:00 *"Gram had, like, one idea. I, I, ...I don't know WHAT Schmidt did"* 😂
Two seconds later: *"Meh, we don't need either of them actually."* 😂😂😂

I read the comments in advance, then waited patiently for that roast 🦃🍗. Not disappointed 😂👽

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
We learn this subject at high school in Russia

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
my math class is using the textbook from Strang atm and these videos pretty much cover the concepts from it. I'm so glad I found this because I can't understand my math teacher at all because of his thick accent. I'm paying for an education but I'm getting it from here.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
oh, these're beautiful, the arc length curves, we just were told to memorize the formulas, while learning them, in highschool, it's eato understand, thank you, Professor🌞

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys I beg you that you help me out with this lecture.This is the 10th time i'am watching this.I understood only the first 4 steps.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks @MIT opencourseware!
It would be great if you can put the lecture title for ease of student. 
thanks!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lecture 8 is Exam 1, so no video was recorded.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy should have used wallis formula for cos^4 theta. this will be a LOT SIMPLER LOL

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is calc 1... 
math is pretty universal the numbers aren't different on their campus. Granted less renown colleges have the majority of their freshmen starting higher than calc 1.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
i confuse headache

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
can you prof "n" is infinity

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When he lists all the topics, it's pretty impressive what has been covered in this unit of the course. I've had to watch videos 11 through 14 about 3 times to feel comfortable with them.Can't wait to see what's next...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
😭😭.. Linear algebra was never understandable to me before, I always it only there to make my life difficult... This series saved me. So much love and respect Prof.Gilbert. Bless you. 💜

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
this guy is a complete mess...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Can someone point out when the vector spaces start? Thanks!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
that is so great!!! My math teacher never teach me this way, she just told us to remember the formula and no need to understand what's behind.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
7:11 the subtitle guy was not technical, lol. So everything is very cursive?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
35:14 Ohh it looks like 12345 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ 41:30 I think you mixed up notation authors. Lagrange's notation is the one that uses the prime symbol. Newton's notation is the dot notation. However, Newton *did* use prime symbols for integration notation; but the prime symbols were placed above the variable.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The facilities they provide and professors that they are hire are among the best in the world.  Those things are not cheap.

They need donations to provide the free education.  This, the free education, costs them money to produce and host.

Don't also forget that MIT went against the will of the rest of the top universities in being the first one to initially provide this free education.  They effectively coerced other top universities to do the same.  They are doing for the benefit of society.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:26 Limits and Continuety

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Exam 4 has misprinted integrand in problem 3. You can find the correct one in the solutions.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are you accepted to MIT? If not, shut up. 

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
We're so impressed about the fact that you all learned this in high school. Shut up about it.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]@[USERNAME]1) is not the definition of the derivative since it is multiplied by (x-xzero)  
Also, independent limit taking is a neat trick.  It really makes no sense intuitively.  That is the whole problem with the proof.  Without independent limit taking you end up with 0/0 in the limit multiplied by some unknown delta f which also approaches zero in the limit under the assuption of continuity.  

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This professor is a genius :)

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Thats A VERY VERY ESSENTIAL lecture for machine learning 
i used to do the transpose trick but didnt know where it come from, know i may die in peace

textbook suggested for this course?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Buy why is trace a sum of eige values and det product of it

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You can't really call this a lecture on Max-min problems if he's doing graph sketching all the way up to 5 mins before the end of the lecture, and only then does he even mention maxima and minima.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To have in America's schools and universities, good grades, you must not be smart. The biggest idiots get  good grades and a student space.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
fantastic

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
God bless you, just love each word comes out of his mouth. Very well explained. Spent a lot of time in books trying to understand the basic concept. The illustrations helped me to grasp the whole idea.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
This lecture is just amazing, what a beautiful thing, all coming together...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is what I call a "valuable" math lecture. Time is spent to explain to students "why" things are true. While in institutions I've been to, time is spent to read slides for students and show them how to solve problems without even having a slightest idea about the procedure there making to solve a problem.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Isn't the dimension of N(C transpose) 14?
Because dimension of C^T is 20 and rank is 6.

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
Math is such a beautiful thing...

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
its good....but too elementary.....we had learn it in High schools

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So far, this was the only difficult lecture. This lecture, I think, I'll need to work out a lot of what he's saying. It was ok in the beginning. It got tough until 30 min, then it gets back to being easy.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
00:00 - 14:20
equation of plane formed by 3 points in space

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great thanks to these awesome lectures which give me insight for matrix...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Those who are seeking a more rigorous point of view may refer to Appendix A.2 of the 18.01 (Fall 2006) course textbook: Simmons, George F. Calculus with Analytic Geometry.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazingly fabulous.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
(1)Does it matter which matrix is taken the conjugate of when computing the standard norm?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Professor Strang is my new favorite person.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What if... It's over 9000? 

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Gilbert Strang is one of the BEST professors in the whole world! He has the power to really transmit knowledge and encourage students to learn more. He’s so charismatic and loves what he does. If a Nobel Prize of Mathematics existed it should be given to him for his great labour to the world of mathematics!!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Respect! Thank you Dr. Strang

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
sorry i'm confused at 32:22, it is 100 ^2, but i think it is 100, why it isn't 100? could anyone explain that to me? thx alot

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
23:37 Wow... Respect to MIT. In my school everyone would have burst out in laughter and it would have taken like 15 minutes to shut everyone up again.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"We don't really know what it means to divide by differentials."

I could have sworn Abraham Robinson was famous for something.. what was that again?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Linear algebra, it's been almost 3 years but I think I've finally got you. *sob *wished I could go back in time

### 18. Properties of Determinants
wtf this math is trivial


### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Does that answer your question?" Incredible respect. We had teachers which said that if you don't understand these you are an Idiot

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What book should i use for this course .

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I can only grasp the subject from figuring out what he draws, because his explanations just make me crazy. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Dude

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Great lecture!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is so much clarity in his words and explanations and how he does applied to examples in to our reall life just brilliant {Se magnific } I wish he was my teacher !!!!! {+_+}

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
great lecture again..

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 14:10 he makes a minor error, that really doesn't matter since its squared, but he says dy/dt of cos t = sin t when it should be -sin t.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I'm really trying to see why matrix multiplication should work the way it does and I cannot find a good resource that talks about this specific topic. The fact that not even Gauss could see it is somewhat a consolation but I'd really love to get my hands on a nice explanation.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Is it just me, or do you also see a face on the board at 30:01?

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
omg.... I know this is stupid, but I have to say it. That movable board is awesome man!!! Go MIT!!!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
If you mash right at a steady pace, you can hear my last brain cells spiriting away in agony as I try and fail to comprehend Linear Algebra.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
such a down to earth professor and speaks in such a friendly manner(Y)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It's just a helpful way to think about it, as we can see when he talks about inverses.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome erasing skills at 35:00

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks! Took this course parallel to the linear algebra course at my university and this gave a much better understanding of the material. Amazing :) greetings from germany.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Really useful lecture!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:31 would ya just look at it?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Is this statistics related to business field?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
From Yemen .. I LOVE YOU DR. GILBRT STRANG

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thanks prof

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
such great lecturing makes me wonder what part of MIT student success is due to innate ability and how much due to superior teaching

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
When he said this lecture is the Beginning of Real Linear Algebra,I got goose bumps

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
26:29 I summarize all his interpretations of the question as "Which columns in A are redundant to create C(A)?"

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
This lecture is amazing...

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:07

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I guess that's the problem with highschools, they gave us the formulas when I took calc in my university. Calc shouldn't be about memorizing 40+ formulas, but knowing when and how to use them or at least being able to derive some formulas on your own and understanding why they work.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What can I say... I'm taking this lectures at night, before going to sleep, and I never thought I'd like to study calculus just for fun. I don't even like to study at all, but all these MIT lectures are so interesting! Also, Denis is cute :3

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the good thing about this is that he assumes you know nothing about vectors. My instructor at JHU went through the first few chapters because he assumed that we knew all the basics of vectors. MIT isn't a great school for no reason. I can tell already how much MIT respects its students.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That was a really clean demonstration of Least Squares. I would recommend that a look on Prof. Strang lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osh80YCg_GM to have the linear algebra perspective.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Fyi just a small clarification to Professor Strang first equation on eigenvalue decomposition. In general, the decomposition is : A = QLamQ_inv which in the case of a symmetric matrix, S = QLamQ_trans. In this case: Q_inv = Q_trans. Thankyou Wolfram Math World and python

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Kok kelasnya sepi? Hayoo pada titip absen yaa :))

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you so much. QtAQ

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I believe he is talking about ReLU and Batch norm? I'll find out!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Anyone have the intuition about why projection and least squares arrive at the same solution? My only piece of intuition is the notion of "length" is kind of "squared"

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is too easy for a college student

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I'm doing a master's in Germany and we were supposed to go through all the lectures as an introduction to a course called Advanced Mathematics for Engineers. At the beginning I was quite reluctant to do that, but after the first lecture I couldn’t wait for the next one. Professor Strang is indeed a great teacher. Thank you MIT for sharing these splendid lectures!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
"If a matrix takes a vector to zero, there is no way its inverse can bring it back to life!" - Gil Strang

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When I become teacher, I will clearly do geometric proofs! =D Love these ones, although the lack of precision. Look for better proofs at "proof wiki". There are a lot of good proof there. =)

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
This lecture confused me from 20:00 onwards. Lots of leaps in this lecture

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
May I ask you guys a question, do Single Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus cover all the content of calculus and real analysis?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
F'N lol. This is where my brain is at.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
That whole first few seconds was me in Fall 2020 as an instructor. :(

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
sir you are awesome

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Thank you so much, MIT

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I'm watching this with airpods and i was wondering why his voice pans in my right ear until i realised his recorder is on his right hip. Still, great lectures!

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"The Sine" "The Cosine"

lol

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Could have saved so many hours of useless cramming, mugging up and god knows what if I had found this earlier..

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree. Some people don't need to be an ass. 

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
A great video! I have to notice that T(0)=0 "proof" is a bit funny :)

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
He never erased "ULA" off the wall.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Paul is a lucky guy.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At all the school-kids out there: how many lessons do u need to unterstand it? Is this hour enough? Yes? Then go on in the same speed ... sure, you have made it in school. But this lesson is to be sure, that everyone has the same basics ... think about it ;-)

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 4:40 it sounds like he says "Wir werden to use the same method..." kinda funny, haha.

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
hate this threom

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
20220527 簽

He's got the most cute french accent ^^

Great Lecture

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
aight need to watch this again. matrix multiplication as elim and movement

### Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers
I was surprised to read that the real numbers are not countabal.  Uncountable, sure, but uncountabal?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I haven't seen matrices since college.  This is the absolute best explanation I've aver seen: clear; methodical; complete! I can't wait 'til Monday (Ooh! I don'e have to: there it is!)

### 12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
With all my endurance I listen to this saga until this lecture just to understand  Linear Regression

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
One like from India 🇮🇳

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why am I binging these at 1:35 AM? I am not even in university yet...

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Hats off to professor Gilbert strang

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
to the one who asked what the 32 and 11 stood for, for E21 means entry of the 2nd row, 1st column.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Thank you MIT

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Excellent!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
How come 4x4 Matrix has 24 P's ?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Lecture 8 :)

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Thank you very much dear professor Strang. You have been saving and will save so many students.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
U guys learn this in mit !! in india this is  taught to 15-16 yr old

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't believed it: https://youtu.be/PIqwV3Kfc44

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Just leaving my mark, I was a part of this circus

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What does Q.E.D mean?

### 17. Markov Chains II
"The memory of where you started washes out..". Restatement of mathematical equations like this makes these videos a gem. Thank you, MIT!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
To think maths like him when old, requires passion and consistently.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks to the professor  for this lessons! In our country there is no way to understand in such an easy way such kind of lesson
Thank U again, keep uploading

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
38:24 Why does σ/(σ^2+δ^2) go to zero when σ goes to zero? I think it should be infinity because 1/σ (σ approaching zero) is 1/0 = infinity. Any one explains? Thanks!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Implicit differentiation inverses From Your

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow this is crazy all theorem and proofs and no actual problems to practice i would be pissed 

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you mit, supposing i am going to donate , how can i do this from iran?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
42:01 
It think it is d/dx not d/dy.
🤔🤔🤔🥶 🇧🇩❤️

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think there's a mistake at 9:36 . Instead y + dy should be x + dx, and it'll become (x + dx)^1/3 = y + dy

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Anyone know what the jingle at the beginning of the video is?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
i have a question ? kindly tell me  If statistics are not available for any experiment then how we  calculate the probability. Give examples please .....

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In math everything is beautiful, it is the most elegant way to view the world.:D


### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Absolutely fantastic! Such a pleasure to learn about this interesting topic by a gifted teacher like Gilbert Strang.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
lifesaver and im going to cross register every math class at mit. dont know why my professor assume im smarter than mit students

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
no el elemento (3,3) deberia ser -3? bueno.. de ahi en fuera entendi todo muy bien :)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you professor

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
These lectures are actually fun! The book is also great. Thanks Gilbert.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
36:54 'I don't know why the author put these in here' . Funny part is he's the author of the book.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
I hope he breaks the curse

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
My teacher in our college just told us how to calculate Ax=b, but didn't explain the reason.
How exactly does the teacher in the video understand linear algebra is.
Conclusion that:1. Ax=b has solutions only when b is contained in column space of A. The solution may be multiple.
2. Consider all the x, which satisfy Ax=0, all the linear combination is called null space.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
couldn't have been better....great lecture.... :)

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is the need for approximation really just to prove that the (slope y/x at theta -> 0) -> infinity? Don't we still can derive that when theta is 0 or multiple of pi using the parametric equations? Sorry for my bad English.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Thank You.... Excellent lecture!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
He talks about it in lec 2. He doesnt prove it, though.

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
35:39 the left theta mle - theta should have a transpose just like in the slides.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
@[USERNAME]I don't believe I ever learned that the eigen vectors of a symmetric (or orthogonal) matrix are orthogonal. That seems... magical...

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Long live!

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The last bit shows that there is no other way to calculate the area of a wedge like that than by dividing it to a triangle and a sector. This is IMHO one of the best showcases of sector being an unique area. It's the same thing about segment that it is a diffrence of a sector and a triangle.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I watch on 2x and understood everything and now i am feeling like i need to watch again in 0.25x

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
00:00-10:00
Intro to vectors, unit vector, finding length of a vector

10:25-15:00
Vector addition and subtraction (algebraically and graphically)
Scalar multiplication

15:00-25:00
Dot product
a dot b = |a| |b| cos(theta)
a dot a = |a|^2

26:13-31:30
Computing lengths and angles using dot product
cos(theta) = a dot b / |a| |b| 

31:30
The sign of the dot product is the same as the sign of cos(theta)
If a dot b = 0 then cos(theta)=0, a and b are perpendicular
If a dot b < 0 then cos(theta)<0, theta > 90 degrees
If a dot b > 0 then cos(theta)>0, theta < 90 degrees

34:30
Equation of a plane using dot product

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I am really glad to see you again prof.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
37:29 Here's where the genius says about his favourite subject.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
I am confident once I went through a Refresher up to this point that his explanation will be as clear as water😀 Because none of my advanced mathematics professors ever explained in such detail!! Awesome professor 👍🏾🙏

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
At 31:20
does a dfa converted from nfa always contain 2^q states ?
I mean , Q' is equal to P(Q)  or Q' is a subset of P(Q) ?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
On 12:19 an Motorola batery is empty

### 18. Properties of Determinants
He is a virtuoso

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The lecturer's name is David Jerison. It's on the title slate at the beginning of the video, and you can also find it at the MIT OpenCourseWare site.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
You're the legend.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shame that when I was in middle school, the math curriculum went up top algebra. I think students should at least finish Pre-Calculus by middle school. It saves time.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"you guys wanna know this because planes need it"..... um asteriod anyone?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
What an absolutely incredible lecture!!!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Some student's questions are quite retarded... the lecturer is awesome!


### 1. Introduction to Statistics
The lecturer mumbling most of the times

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is way too much over my level, i need more practice.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Cramer Rule is good for solving 2 by2 and 3 by 3  linear equations.  Dr. Strang it seem me to that you are turn off by Cramer rule, however your lecture on the subject was another masterpiece. The volume of a box is also explained very well using determinants.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Superb!!!

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Thank you professor Strang for all these lectures! I've remembered why I used to love math!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
hat meet rabbit 🐇

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
started from 18.06 then to 18.085 and 18.086 cannot thank enough, professor Strang is a wonderful lecturer

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know Dr. Jerison won't be able to see this comment, but I just really want to say that, even though Dr. Jerison probably have vaguely guessed his impact from this Calculus course. But he would never know how MANY chinese students have their calculus SAVED by him. In fact this MIT OCW project has world impact, it will be a monument of the early Internet age

### 18. Properties of Determinants
ayeee back here again!!! This is a great lecture! amazing details about the properties and proofs. I was just wondering how the hell det A = ad-bc. can't stop thinking about it. And here we areeee. Professor Strang proved it!!  Thank you Professor Strang and MIT OCW!! U are the best!

### Lecture 18: Weierstrass's Example of a Continuous and Nowhere Differentiable Function
bro this guy looks like anthony fantano but math version

### Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem
First of all, thank you so much for this clear and lucid presentation of the material. At 7:30, when Dr. Rodriguez illustrates the example of the complement of an open ball in R^2, he states that the set is neither closed nor convex -- I believe he meant to say that it is only non-convex (it would be closed by definition, as the complement of an open set in the usual metric topology) which would demonstrate the necessity of convexity; the minimum norm occurs across the boundary of the disk. If it were both closed and convex as a counterexample, we couldn't conclude that either property was necessary for the length-minimization property to hold. To show that being closed is also needed, we could also (in addition to Dr. Rodriguez's second example) take an open ball not centered at the origin: a unique minimum-norm element (some point closest to zero) would occur on its boundary, which the ball does not contain because that is its set of limit points.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is kind of strange Im a high school student and to be honest I don't feel like this is really complex, so is MIT really some exceptional college, or is it mostly reputation?? that was pretty simple.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you so much Sir! Making a lecture without students at that time. Seeing your lectures is way easier than those college lectures that directly start with vector spaces second day.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
In 1:08:10, those lambda's should not be eigen values of Sigma ? (or covariance matrix ?)

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At first, I though "rangle" was just a weird shorthand for rectangle

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Best linear algebra course ever! Best wishes for Prof. Strang's health during this horrible pandemic

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the idiot who filmed this particular video just focused on the professor - so when he walked away and was looking at the board, this person would focus the camera on the person - not the equation he was talking about.. not too bad, but the others were done much better.  - if you aren't quick writing things down, you have to pause often.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
If P(AUB) = P(A)+P(B) for independent events then why is the following solution wrong? Roll 4 4 sided dice. What are chances of getting at least on 4? P(AUBUCUD) = P(A)+P(B)+P(C)+P(D) = 1/4+1/4+1/4+1/4. I know this is wrong so save your breath in posting the correct solution which is 1-(3/4)^4. Why is the solution wrong? It's a good question and will raise an important point.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
30:15.....  I thought the answer would be 1/3 however you wrote down 2/3. I don't understand that?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It's so irritating that the subtitles are not synced with the audio :/

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Quarentena

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I pity about the 19 freaks who disliked this video lmao. these are the actual dumbos.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Measure the curve mabey itself ..it's inner area. Same eggs

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
"Take a breath. Okay the tape won't but the lecturer will " Hilarious :D

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
He should learn how to teach from Gibert Strang

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
He makes everything look so clear.

### 34. Final Course Review
I never learned LA in my undergraduate because I was scared of performing poorly. However, I need to know this stuff for a Neural Network class I am taking in my masters. I am so thankful that courses like these are open to public viewing, as I was able to complete the course lectures, learning this invaluable math. Now I feel more prepared and ready to tackle this next course.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i had this done in high school

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is a fine lecture on elimination of matrices that I am finally learning for the the first time. DR. Strang, I love the way that you  explain matrix multiplication.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
u forgot to multiplay c and d with 5 in 21:10

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
my goodness... he's such a badass lol

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's a Spanish thing, the 'j' makes a sound like the 'h' in English. Like Jalapeño. Looks like he's from Mexico.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT students...they even dont know determinant..wtf..


### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
what is the mean "sines of the eigenvalues"？ Thanks,

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I am an engineering student at a two-year college that shall go unnamed. I can follow this man's MIT lecture far better than any other math professor I've had at junior college....Go figure.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
https://youtu.be/C0qrjkfg5wA

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
really a fantastic professor, explain all this idea so clearly and naturally. I was confused about fourier series before, now I am pretty clear!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Just love the way he teaches ! Thank you 

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
anyone know if this course is for engineers only?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
9 vectors in 9  combination may fill up the information a sort of plane Rishy's apply for genetic control of humanbeings.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I am so addicted to these lectures.. 
Thanks MIT and Prof Gilbert Strang. 


### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
@[USERNAME]Gradients per second is not a real unit or measure.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I can assure that, he has that frenchy accent specially when saying zero

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes, we are all MITer.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the last part about the least squares interpretation gave me a sense of power

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Prof. Strang. Please dont wink at me. I'm too shy. : P

Kidding! I've grown used to it from your linear algebra series 😅

Thanks for your work and all the enthusiasm.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Math is the universal language!!! :D

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
personal notes :
when assigning probabilities to various parts of the sample space, we do not assign them to individual parts fo the sample space, rather to subsets of the sample space.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you prof. Strang for your work. Your original linear algebra book has a special place in my heart. I'm sure this course will be amazing too.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yes but because you differenciate that and G(a) is always a constant then its derivative is G'(x)

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
taylor series are awesome everyone flipped shit HAHAHA!! Stupid MIT kid

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lôpital lu!!!!!!

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
merde.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
this lecture NEVER GETS OLD.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
24:44 thanks to prof. strang that he didn't get away by just taking an easy example and explained other cases where it didn't work.
.
.
.
32:20 the way professor strang visualise the 9 dimensions is so impressive

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
19:20
Front row be like

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Tumhara thik nhi h lecture 👍

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Strang is very knowledgeable and a pleasure to listen to. I really got something out of his class (es).

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The material is easy, but It became so tedious and was not explained in any creative ways, voting it down.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
How do we get A2 from A1 ??

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 07:28, you might want to make clear that w denotes one component involved involved in the second derivative. Then we care about its sign. 

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
The final formula on the right side should be plus instead of minus.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
donation? MIT has money to blow. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Think he has enough chalkboards lol

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
9:45 - Strang: "Columns of C are combinations of columns of A", how? - Is it not the combination of columns of B?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
huge respect, such a good lecture

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
25:12 awesome camera work

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Lecture itself is fine but you need to hire an actual human to operate the camera.  I assume you're using an owl or something similar and it is nauseating to have the camera swing around every second.  The lecturer doesn't need to be at the center. The notes on the board should be, and the camera should be kept steady on them.  A human student even if new woth a camera would know this and I highly encourage you to use one in the future.

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
So does this mean that all (symmetric) rank k changes to a (symmetric) matrix form a partial order?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Totally nailed it 🔥🔥🔥

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent class and excellent lecturer, i think that the guys didnt see the basis of linear algebra thats the reason that prof Auroux gave them an introduction of analitic geometry and elemental algebra, there are assignments that in Mexico are elemental at Facultad de Ingenieria UNAM: algebra(real numbers,  complex numbers, polynomials, ecuation systems and matrices), analytic geometry (polar curves, curves at space, vectorial algebra, surfaces), linear algebra (vectorial spaces, transformations, change of bases, function dependence; linear combinarions and theorems) obviously differential and integral calculus and finally in elemental maths vectorial calculus(multivariable calculus) that is linked to this, but prof Auroux resumed the basis in 2 hours thats awesome

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought the most important part of Applied math was problem solving and the most important part of pure math(creating new math) was proofs.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
the fact that zero vector can be a subspace - what significance does this have in real-world problem solving ?

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
anyone knows where I can find this practice exam they're solving?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
33:40 Correction: Eigenvalue matrix be multiplied to S from the right. That has been made in the book. Probably, it slipped off Prof. Strang in the flow.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
thank you!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
35:00 matrix norm

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That one moment at 25:15 where he turns around and gives some unfortunate student  a genuinely chilling professorial stern look......priceless.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How come, my professors at Uni told me that sin(30º) was acceptable, but the professor here says that it must be radians, otherwise it would be wrong?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
4:20 If A is singular then $\lambda=0$ is an eigenvalue
15:00 An nxn matrix will have n eigenvalues and the tr(A) will be the sum of the eigenvalues
19:30 “A repeated lambda is the source of all trouble in 18.06”
25:00 Shows the polynomial contains the trace and the determinant, in the 2x2 case.
37:15  Example: Rotate vector by 90 degrees
38:47 The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues.
44:20 If we stick to symmetric matrices, or close to symmetric, then the eigenvalues will stay real.
46:50 With a triangular matrix, we can read the eigenvalues off of the diagonal

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
The solution for x involving w and z should be w+(v^T w)z/(1-v^T z). Strang has (vw^T)z in the numerator.

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
Mathematically speaking, it does not tell you about distribution of Sn. Wow!! Thank you so much. Have done many revisions of this series.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Thanks a lot to the person incharge of the camera...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The key ideas all in one lecture! Bravo Dr. Gilbert Strang! Love your presentation!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hello every MITers

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]i totaly agree this is insane! My mathematics degree is much much more difficult than this!!!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks　you!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
this is a bazillion times more straightforward and clear than the lectures i pay for at my university. :( I appreciate this being online

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
11:20 the matrix is not a rotation of any angle, it is actually a reflection.
(You can see that from the fact that det(Q)=-1)

### 18. Properties of Determinants

It would be easier if 5 penguins are used as a "weak sample" to work through the markov theory

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is fucking dope

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
if they have the same the subspace they exist in the same dimension? is that it

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
49 min in and still hoping he'll get to PCA soon hahaha... great lecture though

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Absolutely amazing!

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The prof did not have enough sleep the night before.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Sir. You are very handsom

### 3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph
Those blackboard dusters seriously need to be banged outside!!!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"20:28 Cannot integrate $\sqrt{2-2\cos t}$ ???? "  isn't that already in the text he is using ? I am sure every single textbook contains that   .... I assuming that nobody at MIT is actually watching this.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man he's so swift with that chalk lol

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
DR. Strang ,thank you for another classic lecture on orthogonal vectors and subspaces. Professor Strang, you are the grand POOBAH of linear algebra.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Everything goes over the head... Bad Professor... Cant even explain what is the rotation of a vector got to do with a matrix. He asks us to memorize the matrix !!!!!!! 
I am watching the course for a refresher. The lecture is missing some big chunks of information !!! 
For ex: Professor introduces Matrices with the help of a product of the matrices - Which according to me is like explaining velocity to define distance between two points !!!!
I would have explained it better given the same time !!!! 
Pray he does not do the same with tougher topics that are yet to come !!!!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"instantaneous rate of change" newton is rolling in his grave lmao

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Right, this is starting to get hard now; first lecture that I've struggled with in this course.
I still think he is basically a good teacher, but he was just going a bit too fast; need to go back over this with a book.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
My favorite example of two bases for the same space: in the old days your showers had two knobs that let you adjust cold and warm water (per time). Modern showers let you adjust volume per time (~= warm + cold) and temperature (~= warm - cold). For every configuration of temperature and volume per time, there is some setting of cold and warm that achieves that configuration, but it might be tricky to find.

[Probably in practice this system is not linear. But it feels about right.]

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
W. Gilbert Strang, you are a gem of a teacher!  Thank you so very much!!

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Is there a way for us to check the notes he is referring at 51:05 ?


Here is what i understood from this lecture:


1.We want to take a sample of a matrix multiplication. Recalling that a matrix multiplication is a sum of columns by rows, we choose the index randomly and get the corresponding rank 1 matrix.


2. We also want that this method converges to AB if we take the mean of different samples, which means that the expected value of this rank 1 sampling is AB. This will force us to rescale the sample by 1/pj.


3.Knowing this, we conclude that taking the rank1 sample of a matrix means taking (1/pj)*(aj*bj). Sampling isnt just about choosing a random index j, but rescaling the rank 1 matrix aj*bj.


4. We dont want pj to be arbitrary, we want it to be optimum in some way, the criteria he used was to choose the pj that minimizes the variance of the norm of the rank 1 sample. This variance is a number and not a matrix since its the variance of a norm.


5. Here comes the procedure he showed which is finding the formula of that variance and then apply langrange multiplier method.


However, i cant explain the presence of the "s" variable and the magical appereance of the Frobenius norm at 35:01


Although i can´t explain them, they should be there because otherwise, with that specific optimum pj, variance of norm turns to be zero, and i have the feeling that a zero variance is not a good conclusion. 


If someone has a good answer for this please let me know.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
The twist at the end was better than that of GOT's.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The quality of these are so high I forget they are in 480p

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
This is a masterpiece by DR. Gilbert Strang of MIT. In control engineering, which is part of electrical engineering  linear algebra is a must. All students in this field of study, graduate and undergraduate must know linear algebra.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks！

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
16:40 you can also use the special integration formula
1/a * arctan(u/a) at that point

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
Thank you for sharing us human these invaluable contents.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This lecture becomes so laborious by giving abstract theory first instead of examples.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
How is this an intro?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Determinants; cross product From Your

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think the teacher should finish an idea first and then move on with the assumptions ... otherwise he just confuses

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
35:00 why does it kill the basevector v2?  is it because it transforms it?

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is for real. Not just for birds.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Best

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is a good idea to outline the contents of each tape in writing. The title, the chapter and the section that each tape contains. Like indexing each tape or giving an overall index for all of the tapes in a particular subject, say calculus. Thank you

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I'd watch these lectures for the fun of it. His Linear algebra lectures were amazing.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
heh off to uni soon and good to brush up on A-level stuff =)

### 16. Markov Chains I
nice explanation..thanks

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
35:35 He seems to claim that positive definite matrices must be symmetric. But that' cant be true.. [2,0;2,2] is positive definite but not symmetric!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
If anyone manages to see this, should I have done differential equations by now; or not? Also, before differential equations, should I do calculus 3/multivariate calculus; or differential equations first?
Thanks to anyone who responds and I hope you have had a lovely day so far!

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why du*dv = 5*dx*dy ? 'A' region is a rectangle but A' is a parallelogram and its area is not du*dv ...

### Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions
at time 44:38, c f(x) > alpha implies f(x) > alpha/c only if c>0. If c<0 it becomes f(x) < alpha/c

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Im a bit confused when he talked that the gradient vector is perpendicular to the circle x^2 + y^2 = c ? did he mean that it's perpendicular to the tangent of the circle. And is that vector's direction parallel to the xy plane ?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I wonder what rally was going on...

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
32:25 there is an error. Is not (1+1/2 u) but (1-1/2 u)

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love these vids... but why do they cheer whenever he erases the board?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Magnitude of cross product is the area..
But how do I find the magnitude of a vector that has three components
i,j,k?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
where is lecture 10

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Beta distribution can be bimodal when both a and b are less than 1.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]..obviously you're still stuck up thinking like a modern day cavemen..you should atleast check out some of the very same teachings done by "idiots in indian colleges by indian professors"..not that everyone follows the same way of teaching..but you know what I meant..( type in ITT madras"..)..Goodluck cavemen :)

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
same here.

Oh how I wish my Linear Algebra professor had been this clear !!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I have passed enough math and other subject exams.i quit class because other students and lecturers are crazy

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Instead of using the double angle formula and expanding the square he could've used complex exponentials to linearize cos theta to the fourth, right?

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Someone get that gent a chair and a overhead projector.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Can somebody please explain why they're called E21 and E32?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Can anyone tell me how the professor prove row rank = column rank? I am confused. I think the professor just gives a specific example, not a proof.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
This is another fine lecture on inverses. This the first time that I have seen Left, Right and Pseudoinverses in a linear algebra class. I really learned these topics from DR. Strang. These topics are important in linear algebra, signal and systems theory and control engineering.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
wow this is leaps and bounds better explained than my university teacher

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
For all of you who made it to this point in this great course I recommend watching this short serie before taking the final reviews. Full of graphics with some good aha moments. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
15:00 , You had lunch. you are strong. LOVE Prof.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
What's the difference between the two texts ,one shown by the sir and "linear algebra and it's applications"?

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
For those who are confusing about the deviation process for (A+UV^T)^-1, please check this website of wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%E2%80%93Morrison_formula

### 34. Final Course Review
Strang is love

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Such a fantastic series. He breaks everything down so clearly. It also amazes me how fast they cover the material.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I believe we live in a simulation now.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
April 2018?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The proofs that the limit of sin x/x and (1-cos x)/x tend to 1 and 0, respectively, as x approaches 0 could have been rigorously shown using the squeeze theorem. But, at this point, they haven't been introduced to the squeeze theorem yet.

### 14. Poisson Process I
@[USERNAME]The lector doesn't explain it, but in that part he is working with one of the several definitions of the Poisson process, in which the process is defined as  a Lévy process. Deep knowledge of mathematical analysis, specifically measure theory, is required to understand these infitesimal properties of Lévy processes, that's why he doesn't say much about those second order terms.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
vector spaces and subspaces are the most fundamentally important concepts of linear algebra to build a good foundation...no one is in class..

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
He completely changed my view on linear algebra. The whole thing is just amazing!

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
well i did .
before watching this video .

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Inputting 100 cubic centimeters and 1 cubic meter yielded different answers because _the inputs were different._

One cubic meter equals one million cubic centimeters because we're calculating in the 3rd dimension. In the 2nd dimension, one square meter equals ten thousand square centimeters, and in the 1st dimension, one meter does equal one hundred centimeters.

When converting units in higher dimensions, you _square or cube the conversion factor._

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Audio channels fixed!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
This course has something against the left ear.

Am I the only one who thinks that his writing on the board is very efficient and clear?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
all the properties of determinants are like his little babies for Prof.Strang. He cants choose one over the other, they are all key properties :).

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Respect Mr Auroux. Watched the entire series, camera man is the worst, chalk quality is amazing, very good explanation. Thanks MIT.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Too bad i hate the chalk sound on the board.

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Excellent accent

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
it seems the S-M-W formula he presented has a typo. It is plus, not a minus.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I'm 17 and on my second year of uni, physics...what's your point? :O 

### 13. Bernoulli Process
While deriving distribution of time until kth arrival, it appears we have assumed that there will never be two arrivals in succession..! Does the argument change any bit if this assumption doesn't hold..? More so are we really correct to assume this at the first place?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How do we find x(t) , y(t), and z(t)
For a given three vectors?

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
these are new things in math , im very excited to see this

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
how does his theorem in 30:55 mean that the MLE just going to be an average?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I like this trick (a^T*b / a^T*a) * a = a * (a^T*b / a^T*a) = (a * a^T) / (a^T * a) * b = P * b.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Having such a person makes me love maths

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you have too little, the federal government gives you enough grants to make up for it =P

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
Dear Professor Strang, you and your lectures are more than gold. I just googled what the rarest and most  precious metal is, and it turns out to be Palladium, so you and your lectures are pure Palladium!
Everything in the video is clearly explained, informative, clarifying and vastly illuminating. I'm excited about what is to come in next in the video lectures! 
Bravo and applause

the rest wont be uploaded-.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
After all theses years, MIT finally decided to post pure math videos.
I haven't thought such a day would happen...

### 18. Properties of Determinants
thanks a lot, professor

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
In windows 10 you can force mono sound:
Go to settings [win+i] > Accessibility > Sound; and here you have a toggle for combining both channels.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
candy bars lol

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thanks for sharing this

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
damn, you'd think that at MIT the professors would go at a much faster pace and talk as if assuming the students already know this shit, but this professor just oozes clarity at every step. My prof here at usc skips a lot and talks too fast lolz

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you nailed it!!!

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the way dis nigga talks is so nice

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
i'm wondering that when he draw the picture of the complete solution , why doesn't the Null space pass the origin ?

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Too helpful for me

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] I'm sorry for your compact mind. You think that a black board is what defines a prestigious institution. You do not deserve to know this course at all.


### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
The best linear Algebra teacher!!

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
Really irritating how the camera follows the lecturer's every movement rather than staying on the blackboard.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
😖😖 He's the best professor I know and yet my brain doesn't get it at once😂

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
Can anyone explain how projection matrices and fitting the lines automatically minimizes the least square error?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Watching this in 2020, legendary to date!

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
43:26 Min why does the nullspace stay the same?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
How I understood the beginning example about the mean: We defined our sample space to be Omega = { [a,0] , [0,b] }. We defined the distribution over this sample space to be uniform (hence the 1/2). Now each sample can be seen as a random variable which takes on one of the values in Omega. By definition, the expectation is the sum of the products of each outcome with its probability. However, if we define a random variable to be the sum of the samples then we get the expectation of the new random variable is sum of the expectations of each sample. Each sample has the same expectation thus we can reduce the sum to a multiplication by s. 

PS I don't have very advanced knowledge of probability theory (I'm taking a course right now). If I have made a mistake let me know.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
既に学習済みの内容なら英語の授業でも全く問題ないです。英語の数理経済の論文を読んで授業に備えます。

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't get too convinced about his explanation of wich he called properties A and B. It seems to me than that doesn't work that coherently... first of all because he said it only works in radians, wich is an error because the trigonometric functions are the same no matter the unit, but most importantly it finishes up seeming that both functions result 0/0... wich i could accept as 1 by stretching my mind, but never as 0.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He adds -x/xo^2 to the left as he adds -1/xo to the right.
It looks like this:
-1/xo=-x/xo^2+1/xo
X/xo^2=2/xo

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Thanks to MIT for explaining that one. I can think of an explanation for the origin of that phrase. You see, the Summer gets "tricked" into thinking it's gonna last. But alas! The Winter inevitably comes and the few days of its warm reign are over. And just like this short-lived summer period, the Indians got tricked by their conquerors too. Thus the term, "Indian Summer".

And Thank You MIT for these wonderful videos. Keep up the great work!!
Great Profs teaching in a great way! 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this is so beautifully explained!!!

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
what is the reason behind R being upper triangular?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
One problem a bit confusing. Normally a square of a matrix is the transpose with the matrix, the example here is like BB.

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Minute 40. Left nullspace. I am yelling in my room: "Yes! Is there, I am looking at it!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Since I got a full-time job, I don't understand math anymore.  I guess I'm better at calculating money than numbers lmao

love the tranquil waterfall in these MIT classrooms

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
my bookmark 37:00

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't like how this man erases the board. But I like his explanation.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Sorry for my humble input, but this lecture on linear transformation should have been at the beginning of the course.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

These people are talented and teach in such a easy way!
I always thought that I was  dumb but no.
Actually I haven't watched this before!
Thanks MIT!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This Mathematician's handwriting is exquisite

### 14. Poisson Process I
To derive the formula at 26:07 (Poisson distribution) from 25:06 (Binomial distribution), you need to write combination as factorials, then use stirling approximation for factorials and the definition of e

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Prof Strang is an example that age is no bar for learning

DOPE

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent! 

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is so helpful. I adore professor Gilbert so much. It was a bit surprising to go straight into linear equations at first, but it worked out in the end.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Man the energy ...  even though his body aged, his mind, movements and mimics are the same ... I never attend to your class physically but probably I learned more efficiently than my 20 years education best wishes for you !

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
OMFG I thought he was saying HOLE or HOE instead of ROW around 26:50 lol I was so confused.... x2 speed am I right?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I've waited almost a whole year for these lectures!!! Thanks Gil, you really bring a topic to life.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I have nothing but Love for you sir.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
i dont know if that is the right way to learn mathematic 
because the goal of mathematics lecture that the student can later proof mathematical problem ... but i dont see here any formal defintion or proofs!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Was anyone there?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you for this amazing lecture.It was boring when our teacher explained it but now all my questions faded ^^

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very impressive and helpful specially for the people who can't afford to study but still want to learn in life.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
Thank you for making this SO INTUITIVE. You rock.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I just caught that:  "Keep them in their Gauss-given order" (instead of God-given...hahaha)

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Congratulations on your adoption of Roman numbers at the beginning of your course titles. And it only took you about twenty-five years flat to figure out that putting numbers at the front made it possible for computers to list programs in order. 
Marvellous work, MIT, technical leader of America!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I haven't seen this stuff since 1987. Never used it in Electrical Engineering in my life. This was the most haphazard sloppy math I ever had to take.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
That makes me remember the first semester linear algebra lecture. He certainly takes his time to explain, what the interpretation is and that is wonderful. We were not so lucky unfortunately.

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
" I need you guys, OK?"  We need you too

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Finally thank you

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hello! Why is Professor stop reducing n to zero (30:22) if actually we can continue reducing to negative numbers, e.g. n=-1,-2,-3.

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
at 43:20 isn’t the case smaller the alpha, the larger the constant c, the more evidence against h1 instead of h0? Cuz like in the coin example, if you push the threshold wider to like 3.5 something, you go from originally rejecting h0 to accepting h0.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
oh wow i took calculus in high school and these are mit kids...
i swore that guy was asian

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really intelligent professor of rare kind.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
So, the second component of u(k+1) is useless, right? The actual value is given by the first component.

### 34. Final Course Review
It is a very amazing feeling to complete the course today. It has been an awesome journey. 
Thank you, Professor Gilbert Strang and MIT OpenCourseWare team for these amazing video lectures.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]it's not @[USERNAME]but @[USERNAME]who seems to not have learnt anything from his "co-called" economics studies...his comment proves his whole education is shit lol

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
A=SQ， where A must be square matrix?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
very satisfactory explanation!

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
May I be able to get access to the mentioned and used books on this course

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Is this Mathematical Statistics?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is this instructor from?

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It made me realize that I'm smarter than 1 MIT student - for a minute, anyway.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This series is phenomenal. Every lecture a gem. Thank you Mr Strang!

### 13. Regression
can anybody explain 26:30?

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

He radiates knowledge. Love the content!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought we learn calculus in 11th grade

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I love how the left audio channel is reverb only.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Good professor with good old blackboard and white chalk teaching method. This is way better than all the fancy powerpoints that many teachers use now a days.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
In addition to shouting out answers I knew, I would also applaud right when he said thanks.

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
Please upload videos on measure theory too🙏😊

Nailed it! what an awesome lecture

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice attitude at 30:30

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
dap, 
asa cred si eu , in cateva minute reuseste sa clarifice ce nu au reusit alti profesori in ore de predat. Oare cand o sa avem si noi asa profesori?
Apropos, eu sunt student la IT in Luxembourg si de cele mai multe ori ma simt ca intr-o scoala nu intr-o universitate uitata de lume....
Ma bucur ca datorita acestui gen de site, acest gen de profesori extraordinari sunt "disponibili" si noua celor care nu v-om ajunge sa participam la vreunul din cursulire lor.

### 4. Counting
the way he teaches counting is a real contribution to humanity

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Event B is the whole shaded part, right? 
Not just the part under A3?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The courses of MIT seems really easy, in my university Tec de momterrey, we see more difficult and deeper lectures.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In Da Vinci's words simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. 

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
25:11 I didn't understand this concept . Can anyone explain this in the comments.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Hats on the xs, hats off to Professor Strang!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Excuse me, why doesn't the calculation of F_100 at "46:08"  time the eigenvector X_1? Am i missing something?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
The greatest math teacher in the world now teaches Data analysis, Signal Processing and Machine Learning! Thank you very much!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sorry where can I find the textbook professor was using in the video? What's the name of the textbook? Thanks

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]dude be thankful  , we do not have a professor we have the exam finally lol

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
why should anybody care about this?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Sir ki exercise to classroom me hi ho jaati hogi

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Look how fast this guy writes 😂

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can someone tell me why did he integrated T and Volume ? what formula used ?

### Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers
38:34 to 39:02 I think there is something wrong in the  Lecture Notes WEEK 3 Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers (PDF).

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Those chalks are amazing. I fell in love with the pink ones!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This guy taught me more than I learned when I studied Maths for four years.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
his picture with grad(f) pointing up is a bit misleading around 9:00 I think. grad(f) is a vector in the x-y plane, pointing in the direction you should move in the x-y plane to maximize increase in f.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Shouldn't the empirical covariance matrix be divided by n-1 and not n?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
OK. This stuff is highly confusing, to say the least. As much as one could rather easily understand what a mean of a random matrix is, it's not that simple with variance. Variance is defined for a random variable or a vector. For a simple r.v. that has its values in R^1, it's just the expectation of (X-E(X))^2, that is E[(X - EX)^2]. For a vector that has its values in R^n it's a COVARIANCE MATRIX. Now, what would be the variance of a matrix? I've never heard of such a construct and I've studied maths (specialization: probability and stats) for 5 years at a technical uni. Maybe (and it's a guess) he wants to do this: Take the random element (which is a random matrix with a probability measure picking up a certain matrix out of a set with a probability of p_i, i=1...n, where n is the number of columns in A and rows in B, since we want to sample from all the columns of A, not only some r cols) and subtract from it the "mean element" (the mean of the matrices as calculated), then take the norm of this subtraction (which is a norm of a matrix), square it and multiply by the probability of the element selected. Then sum up over all the elements (sum over the matrices/elements or columns of A, which is the same as there's 1-to-1 correspondence between the cols of A and the set of matrices we're selecting from). So, this would give us the mean square distance of a random element from the "mean element." The distance would be the 2-norm or the Frobenius norm of a matrix/element. But this would be the EXPECTATION of the random function X : M -> R+ (a random map from the set of matrices/elements to R+ where X(*) = || * - EM ||^2, this being the square of the 2-norm of the element/matrix and EM = "the mean matrix", that is AB). So we are calculating the mean of the X mapping but this "variance " (as he calls it) is not some kind of "matrix variance" (as such things do not exist) but the expectation of the mapping as above. I can't explain what he's trying to do in a better way. He wants to minimize the expected squared distance from the randomly selected matrix to the "mean matrix." and hence he looks for a probability distribution on the columns of A that achieves that. At the same time, I don't understand the notation he's trying to use :( Highly confusing, prof. Strang.

### Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem
23:56 category theory burn 😂

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In China, we learned these when we are in high school.😂😂

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You truly are a gentl person, greetings from belgium flandres and many thanks!

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
18:49 Now he won't run out of pronouns

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not able to understand because i'm still an eight grader hahahahahahaha

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Remember to increase playback speed to 1.5x’s.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My professor isn't bad, but he doesn't hold a candle to this professor.  Zero obfuscation.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
16:05
Can we think of these "basis" vectors as unit vectors??

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Gilbert Strang is an absolute gem. <3

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
in the class, the students who were around the age of 25 years, now would be of around 40 years!!

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Does anyone know the deeper reason for why mean=variance=1 in the hat problem at the end?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
People started packing their stuff before he even finished

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
my teacher has a lot to learn yet ... lololol

### 18. Markov Chains III
I do think that calculating the eigenvectors of the system is an easier way to deal with figuring out the space of the steady space and the rate at which convergence happens.  Definitely worth examining as a comprehension supplement. Basically, the space defined by the eigenvectors of eigenvalue 1 is the steady space, and the largest eigenvalue not equal to 1 is inversely proportional to the rate of convergence.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
these kids applaud at the strangest things

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
No.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
4:57 if i transpose these guys, that product, then again, ... : why did he jump suddenly to this theorem without any definition of transpose nor the logical derivation? Did I miss something?

### 16. Markov Chains I
smart example.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
It does not seem like we are going for a perpendicular projection of the data points on the line. Rather we are taking error (e) in vertical directions. Is that still correct?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Review needed

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
@[USERNAME]I was really dumb to think that my time has come and angel of death was just trying to show his presence.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That question was designed to be a bit of a mindfuck. It makes you focus at answering with respect to the normal vector because that is what you have to take the inner product with and put labor. If you are not focused you don't pay attention to the last part, the actual question (and not because of stupidity as many people would rush to imply here).

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What are the Prerequisties for this course. I'm not able to grasp the concepts

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can we just appreciate that he can write in such a good handwriting with such speed in a black boards like MAN THAT CHALK SOUND!!!!!!😩😩❤️❤️

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is great. I never got to learn this stuff in college so it is great to actually learn this at home in my own time which is video after video after video... Accelerated learning is great.

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Dude, get a better eraser. Seriously, it's hurting me.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Excellent explanation about Random variables. Random variables are just dunctions or simply a routine which give us some numerical value.

### 25. Classical Inference III
Finally finished all the videos and problems... Thanks to Prof.Tsitsiklis, TAs and MIT for great lectures!

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
It amazes me that MIT has so shit quality

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Denis: "In case you don't see it..."
Me: By Jove, you've read my empty blank mind.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Hope I will go to UTK, Thank you professor Strang

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is so good.

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at the end he says something about imaginary numbers to rescue the value of that integral calculated naively ...which turns out to be negative... what did he mean?? anyone knows?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
The mathematics fills my heart with beauty.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Einstein couldn't do it, but... Gilbert can!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if only I had known about this open courseware thing when I took calculus the first time, or even the second! Thanks, MIT, for sharing knowledge. Kudos to this professor, for shedding light on this monster class.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
20:55 Does that.......make sense? hehe

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Worth mentioning: if row-reduction of the matrix generates the most natural row space basis without much effort, we can also generate the most natural basis of the column space of said matrix by doing row-reduction on the transpose of the matrix. This is all so incredibly fascinating!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Brilliant lecture! Thank you!

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Gilbert Strang is so cool, thank you!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm a chemical engg. student from India ..i watch mit videos regularly .. it helps me a lot.. sir.. your teaching style is awesome .. thanking you all.. for sharing such videos ...

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thankyou Sir, what a beautiful journey it has been...!!...:)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of the many things I like about this professor:  "Let me tell you BRIEFLY what's in store."  Three minute intro, not twenty minutes of child psychotherapy at the start of the course.  15 minutes in and he's explained the derivative.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
these MIT guys are so dumb. length of the vector should be root 14. It seems many have answered 6. 

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:31 M(2^k) should be there and not M(2)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Lol yeah. I mean I love America with all my heart, but fuck man, the people get treated like shit. All they care about are their rich and super rich. That is why once I graduate, PEACE!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
hi from argentina and thanx for share that with the world, even not in my language this video makes all clear to me.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He reminds me of The Professor from Money Heist...the intelligence,shy nature.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
My teacher's should've taught me this 10 years ago. Imagine where would I be if I knew this way of thinking back then :/

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gr8 1 !!!

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
뿡

### 4. Counting
Exceptionally well explained, thank you

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Thanks!

### 34. Final Course Review
completed it!!!!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
rangle is a funny sounding word.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Gilbert Strang is a treasure to the world. His books are top notch, and the MIT Open Courseware has made it possible for myself and so many others to learn at our own pace. Many thanks Dr. Strang!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I learned this when I was 16-17 in school...dissapointing.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He is like a Linear cell!!!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I have a question, if I project the projection again that's the same point that is P^2=P. But if I keep doing such it should tell P^3=P^4=P^n=P, and this property holds for Identity matrix. Is my logic correct?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
huge respect SIR. Thanks a lot. 
from BANGLADESH

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Gil 3:30.
Eckart & Young in 1936 were both at The  University of Chicago. The paper was published in the (relatively new?) journal Psychometrica. Ekhart had already worked in the foundations of QM with some of the founders. And went on to work in Fermi's section on the Manhattan Project. If I recall correctly, Eckart married the widow of von Neumann. And ended up at UCSD. He was very renowned in applied physics including oceanographicy/ geophysics.

Mr Gale Young was a grad student at Chicago. He also had a successful career taking his Master's from Chicago to positions in acedemia & US nuclear power industry.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
He reminds me of Feynman but he is even more clearer.

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
Our indian teachers are best. 
Jai hind 
Our teaching style is best as it is both side interaction.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Around 33:00, for the right-hand side of 'B', how did we obtain A'b/A'A  * A? 
The previous lesson, we obtained 'p' as aa'/a'a * b. How did the aa' *b in the numerator get switched to A'b * A?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
25:00 why transpose of Row's were taken to find combination of row space? Will we be able to multiply transpose of row 1 to X?

### 4. Counting
Amazing material.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
It is immortal at 2020

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
The captions at 32:15 are slightly off: instead of "manage", it should say "massage".

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if S = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^n
then Sx = x + x^2 + x^3 + .... + x^(n+1)

so S - Sx = 1 - x^(n+1) no?

*edit* okay, after writing it down I suddenly get it, my example is right for partial sums, but this thing goes to infinity.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
to the memory 🖤

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Amazing professor!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Great professor. We used his book for Linear Algebra and he came and taught as a guest lecturer at my University one time, Drexel University. My professor on the otherhand was a total insufferable dick that made the subject waaay more difficult than it needed to be just because he thought it made him look smart. Douche-bag!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Correct me if I'm wrong but Strang was introducing abstract algebra at the end. Once you have all of these linear transformation transforming more linear transformations, you have an even greater transformation of space. Absolutely love this man

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
The golden ratio arose from the Fibonacci sequence and has nothing to do with eigenvectors or eigenvalues.  The beauty of using the eigenvectors and eigenvalue of a matrix though is limiting the effect of the transformation to the change in magnitude only, which reduces dynamics systems such as population growth that is a function of several variables to be encoded in a matrix computation without worrying about the effect of direction or rotation typically associated with matrix transformation. Since eigenvectors and eigenvalues change the magnitude of the parameter vector only, the idea of employing the Eigen transformation concept is quite genius. The same technique could be used in any dynamic system that could be modeled as a matrix transformation but one that produces a change in magnitude only.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Can someone explain how a bunch of vectors are independent when nullspace of A is a zero vector?  
If  N(A) =0 then Ax=0 which would mean the Vs were dependent?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where did the a come from around 14:00?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=titoevCaQcQ

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
You can tell SVD is Professor Strang's favorite topic. This is the only lecture in 9:4 HD and audio channels upgraded.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Hi, I'm from Machupicchu,cusco,PERU. I want to know if it is good for career System engineer, A thousands apologizes if my English is bad.

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Wow

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I love how he's so polite in his lecturing: "Please can I show you this?". Even in his books he's like "I hope you will let me show you this".

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
amazing!!!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Linear-Algebra became trivial because of this guy.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
What a gem of a teacher! A legend. I did not learn C of calculus in 5 years of my engineering studies way back in 1974-79. Then came the blessing in disguise and by the way I had to teach some calculus to my daughter in her graduate course in economics. And that is how I landed onto Professor Gilbert Strang's video and I fell in love with calculus which all these years was kind of a terror to me. What a beautiful and stylish way of teaching mathematics. I never have seen any teacher with such a vast knowledge and at the same time  comfortable teaching beginners. God bless Professor Strang with health a d happiness.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks Professor Strang. 

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Around 14:30 I'm not sure about what that means, could anyone help?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It would be great if he could use less similar looking letters. Uvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvvuvuuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvuvvuvvuvuvu

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Is there a "Gilbert Strang Fan Club?"  If not, there needs to be!  I effin love this dude.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]initially the formula is op=<a*theta-a*sin(theta),a-a*cos(theta)>
but then let 
a=radius 
a=1
op=<theta-sin(theta),1-cos(theta)>

x(theta)=theta-sin(theta)
y(theta)=1-cos(theta)

so here he parametrise the equation differently than before..

before when it was linear system

we can just use  formula 
Q(t)=InitialQ+t*(EndQ-InitialQ)
so if we have 
InitialQ=<1,2,3>
EndQ=<3,1,2>

we get 
x(t)=1+2t
y(t)=2-t
z(t)=3-t

so for curvature and circle it is different than linear system to parametrize the equation

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This kind of calculus have aplications in linguistic???

I wonder how he writes 'e' aside 'l'😂

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
this guy is the worst teacher ever

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Pure Brilliance!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Started this course today. Hope to complete it soon. Loving the journey of learning.

### 17. Markov Chains II
Can someone what is the relevance of the last plot to Markov process, I see it as the number of person at the queue when time tends to infinity. But how can we relate that kind of definition to a markov process, where we just need the probability of any state ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if you proved d/dx [e^u] and d/dx [ln x], then trick x^n =e^ln(x^n) = e^(n *ln x). d/dx [e^(n * ln x)] =(n *ln x)'  *  e^(n *ln x) = (n *ln x)' * x^n = (1/x * n   +  0)*ln(x))*x^n = (n*x^n)/x  =n*x^(n-1)

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
The way he asks Why? Wins my heart.Long Live Strang Sensei

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In India it is a compulsory question for board exam and my teacher just said the conditions as formulas and then made us practise a lot of problems of this kind. That's it!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Idiotic course. He didn't even mention why we add the nullspace to our solution vector pretending he had already done that. Awful course. Impossible to learn linear algebra purely from this course. To all of you that think you are stupid reading those comments of people that this lecture has given insight, don't because they for sure use external resources as well.

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
Dr. Strang is one of the best🙏

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces

when you are talking about your ex

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What was the deal with the delivery at the beginning?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
same bug in the exmple as in pres 7, column 3 and 4 are combinations of 1 and 2, therefore, you have 2 independent 3d vectors, ie. they do not span the space. class in coma.

### Lecture 11: Absolute Convergence and the Comparison Test for Series
Thank you so much MIT OCW!

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a goddamn miracle, that electrically powered black board!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Well, it makes us more intelligent people, for one. But also I hope it helps some people discover the beauty of math in how all these ideas fit together.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I think ill leave this and the next lecture for some other day, coz i dont have enough solid background with diffs to understand these 2 lectures. those who has completed course are this two lectures a must for understanding the rest of the course? thanks

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why  this vid doesn't uploaded last course ? I take a summer course cause of calculus 102    :(

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
It is great that we could press the pause button to think, those "fortunate" students didn't have this luxury, hehehe...  Yeah, they could still do that after lecture, of course...  Internet is great and MIT is so generous to put all these lectures up for free viewing...  Thank you very much

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys I beg you that you help me out with this lecture.This is the 10th time i'am watching this.I understood only the first 4 steps.Please...

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Amazing material. Thank you.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Ah college hasn’t changed! He started with an interesting example, then went into technical speak. He is now relying on equations he knows but the students don’t. He should be giving real common sense examples then using the equations. I am teaching AP stats and he just seems to jump into complicated equations. If this is a first year stats course I feel sorry for the students. It seems teaching at the university level hasn’t improved in almost 40 years.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Mr. Free Lecture! The most famous professor in the world!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this high school level in USA??  professor is really good! 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

indeed, rocked my world! listening to his lecture is a kind of pleasure!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is very informative!! It makes me eager to go to class again tomorrow!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In a lot of classes that come with college, I think a lot of undergrads can relate to the frustration in dealing with concepts that the professor "thinks you should know already", when in reality, you see the course description (and even maybe the title of the course), you find that THING (for lack of better words) is, in fact what you should already know :D ...(hopefully I convey my message clearly; it's the result of not-even-a-semester spent at an engineering university can do)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you weren't paying close enough attention to the French Man.  Some girl actually asked that question...i think he should have done it out, but basically the answer to your question is:

lAl dot lBl   =    lAl lBl  cos (theta)         the second formula is multiplying the lengths of vectors A and B, the first is multiplying the 'components'

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
thanks Gilbert. I am watching the lectures and learning a lot.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
At 32:41 when professor Strang says L2 norm of a matrix is 'sigma1', what does he mean by sigma1?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I am so awed at the depth of maths and the presenter

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you for publishing this!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He moves pretty fast through calc. It's easy to say that if you don't have a little experience with it you'll be confused. 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:00 also in pysics you understand that in our world there is absolutely, pun intended, no repetition. but this is maths and he should stick to it

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

Phenomenal lecture. Merci beaucoup Professor Auroux!

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It is difficult because it deals with some ideas that though simple are very abstract. Some people have a hard time thinking this abstractly. There is also a lot of new notions that don't correspond to anything that is very familiar. Finally, some of the algebra procedures like decomposition for fractions, path integrals and trig substitutions involve manipulating sets of symbols that are more complex than most people know how to deal with. At it core though, the ideas are simple/

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Another way to prove that the determinant of a matrix with a zero row is zero would be to add one of the other rows to that row. That would create a duplicate row, which he proved the determinant of was zero.

### Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
35:05 "y is not a function of x" - can we say that z is a function of x and y?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand why he thinks x is fixed and "delta" x is moving in here: https://youtu.be/9v25gg2qJYE?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1&t=448
Can anybody explain me pls?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
1:48 41:42 Math Humor 101

### 34. Final Course Review
I finished the lectures and took notes myself, which took around 16 days. But I am sure I will keep referring back to here from time to time. The explanation is excellent and generates the engineering style of thinking, problem thinking automatically. Thx Dr.Strang

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

It irritates me that they don’t ever erase completely.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
33：06 why it's 100^2?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
i didn't get why he switched 2 and 3 when talking Gaussian-Jordan elimination? 

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
As a mathematician I'm wondering why it's not mentioned at all, that the "nullspace" is also called "kernel", ker(A) = nullspace(A), where A is a matrix. The column space of a matrix A on the other hand is also called "Image" of A.

Good lecture style. Thanks.

### 13. Regression
This guy makes so many mistakes and is on top of that really hard to follow...

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there is a mistake here??
The base 'e' initially defined at 14:15 was never referred to as natural number, and it was only supposed be some base for which the derivative of e^x is e^x because its slope at x=0 is assumed to be 1. This was never proved. Later on (at 24:30) it was just stated as a fact that e, the natural number, is really that base and that its slope at x=0 is 1. I thought the idea here was to prove the derivative of a^x by proving derivative of e^x, where e = natural number. What am I missing?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Sir ,in the last of lecture How those two column vector passes through the origin ????

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's all I remember from Calc 1,  the derivative of x^2 = 2x lol.  Of course, that was the "shortcut," but we had to do it with all the dy/dx notation.  I remember that I loved doing quotient derivatives for fun.  What's wrong with me?  Linguistics major BTW.

Good class.I studied that,at 17,in spain.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy sounds like dr. scratchensniff from anamaniacs

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is.

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
I like your intelligent advanced lectures.they are very challenging..strang is the smartest.thank you.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Did we prove det(AB) = detA*detB in the lecture?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ah, yes....most of my classmates were 16 years old when we had it in school. For most of my friends it was reaaaallly easy to understand...not for me, I am really bad at mathematics :D So ahm...they have it in university? Isn´t that a little bit late?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
No one ever taught me matrices like this... God why don't we have teachers like him more?

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not gonna lie. I got lost half way

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
It's sad talking to an empty classroom; I could never bring myself to do it.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
his french accent is marvelous :-)

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Gilbert Strang, you are truly an outstanding teacher! I am currently doing my Master's thesis in Finite Element Analysis and started watching these video lectures just for fun, since I already had some Linear Algebra back on my bachelor's. Your little sidenote at the end of a lecture about multiplying a system by A.transpose actually helped me crack a problem I'm dealing with right now. My finite element system had more equations than unknowns (because I'm fixing some internal degrees of freedom, not the nodes themselves) and I just couldn't figure out how to solve such system. I completely forgot about this trick of multiplying by a transpose!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! My final system now has "good" dimensions and the stiffness matrix has a full rank!!!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So you're saying being an engineer is a sedentary job doing calculus and testing out materials?

Geez we are scientists then, not engineers.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Knowing that the class is empty, 19:09 becomes incredibly hilarious.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
00:00 Lecture overview
02:40 Elimination Success
10:35 Elimination Failure
14:30 Back-substitution
18:55 Elimination matrices
33:00 Matrix multiplication
37:00 Permutation matrix 
42:52 Inverse matrix

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I do not understand why at a constrained min/man, in any direction along level g=c the rate of change of f (gradient of f) must be zero? What am i missing?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
awesome lecture!!!

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
woke up this morning with the weirdest dream, i missed the test and had to drop the class. what a nightmare, i am 49 years old, lol.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
really like the lecturer, god bless!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I took stats 35 years ago, and worked as a statistician for a decade before switching to medical translation. I am interested now in my retirement to see how much I remember.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
How much MIT must one do to be eligible for a Brass Rat?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The limit rests on the logic presented by Dedekind

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Doc Strang in 1080P！！！

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is the teacher french?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:12 This is what anarchy sounds like

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
i watched these now for the second time, it's still awesome. oh strang, you are great lecturer!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Maybe by your 'logic'...  on which you're comparing A student, with THE CONTENT OF A lecture?... you're comparing non-comparable things... an acceptable refutal would've been to compare lecture contents. You're judging ONE item of student... here is ONE item of american higher education... don't know were your student is from, the quality of his/her university... but this lecture is supposed to be from the TOP OF USA'S TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITIES. That makes you wonder......

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Anyone understand the equation at 32:15? I think x_free should be above x_pivot?

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I don't think you're qualified to be taking shots at an MIT professor. 


### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much, Professor Strang!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@[USERNAME]i fucking hate proofs

Yo solo queria triangulitos y.u

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Shizzle! He forgot his neck tie!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I have him as a teacher!

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
At 36:38, when A times b, shouldn't the number of columns in A equals the number of elements in b?  Then when you look at A times A times b, does it indicate A is a square matrix?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
15:5 "Let me call that matrix A....s, A Screwed up" Great professor :D

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is a circular argument there in 24:45.
Law of cosines used to prove geometric expression of dot product.
Geometric expression of dot product used to prove law of cosines.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
"evil equations" ^__^

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
MIT has better blackboards than 20 years before when 18.06 was filmed.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
column operations (mp on right), row operations (mp on left)

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Wow he's such a good professor👍👍👍

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Brilliant..

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is it the the deviation formula is squared? i know it must be equal to zero.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is great great great!!!!!!!!!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
The Prof. gives the lecture as though there is a full class. Hilarious:D, but every good explaining.

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Terrible video. What is an example of  a Hilbert space with real numbers in a actual application. This man is just copying lines from a text book but provides no concrete examples that would explain Hilbert. Sad. A waste of time.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ห้องเรียนเงียบจังครับ

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
You are amazing mr Strang. Give me deeper understanding about machine learning

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Such an amazing professor, he turns math into a fascinating story! 
If most teachers at MIT are even 70% that good, that explains how students there get so smart haha

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
@[USERNAME]exactly right m8, im the same

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Notice that the smart ones are using Latex or MatLAB

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
04:30 prerequisites

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Really interesting explanation, “You should not say sth if you don’t have to say it”

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
I finally understand the Pumping Lemma for regular languages!! 😊 I didn’t quite get it by reading the proof in the ’Sipser’ book the first time; but after this really great lecture by the author himself it’s all clear. He gave just the right amount of intuition necessary. Thank you Prof, and thank you MIT for making these courses available to everyone who wants to learn.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3vzfKKY2wU&t=3s

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like how he said at 19:48 that people at MIT are very round

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
👍👍👍👍👍

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture.  I took single variable calculus twenty plus years ago and I enjoyed learning it again.  I look forward to MIT uploading the rest of the lectures and then moving onto multivariable calculus!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
*Just curious:* is it a coincidence that the sum of the errors in the example is zero (-1/6 + 2/6 -1/6 = 0) ?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
WOW HIGH QUALITY THANK GOD

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
A transpose is nothing but the row space right? so Null space of A transpose should lie in row space but professor say A^T.(b-P)=0 ,where b-p =e and e is in column space , but it should be in row space.right?

### 34. Final Course Review
When will the phd application open again? Currently the application is closed already, and I missed it...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I don't understand this at all yet, but this is my introduction to Gaussian elimination so hopefully it will get better the more I study the material

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When you're 100% screwed for finals....

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
TF?!  Why the hell did no one explain the vector origins of determinants to me before???  God damn rote mathematics instruction.  All computation and no theory makes a sad mathematician.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]  Lastima por tí...   ¿hay que recordar?  se recuerda lo que se conoce y despues se olvida, a mi nunca se me informo de la capaciodad de la audiencia así que no tengo que recordar nada sobre ellos... los  "metodos algebraicas" como lo escribes, creo que sé a que te refieres y no son garntía de demostración si no se  profundiza en  la justificación de cada acción algebraica,  si no se hace esto se pueden cometer falacias muy bien disfrazadas

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
omg same O_O 

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watched all; learnt alot..
Thanks Prof.Auroux and MIT💞

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]believe it or not but most of their income is not from tuition, but grants, endowment, and other funding. the costs of world class/cutting edge research is very high.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Around 20:00. Why are the errors "e" the vertical distance between the line and the "b" points? Why don't we look at the shortest distance between b and p which is when you use a distance between b and the line that is perpendicular to the line (not parallel with y axis)?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Muy buena explicación, que buen curso.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
-0.618       1
    1        -1.618
The Null Space of the given matrix should be the zero vector because the RREF will become:
1      0
0      1
Which means the Null Space(and hence the Eigenvector) is the zero vector for the first Eigenvalue?
Correct me if I'm wrong?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Amazing, thk u MIT and Prof. Gilbert Strang.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In this you learn that MIT students are the most disrespectful students as well as the chain rule.


### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
positive definite matrices start at 35:14

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thanks for sharing this video, it helped me a lot.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
What a great lecture this Professor gives... That's probably why MIT is so good, they actually hire teachers that can teach! Congratulations

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
We assume that the misconception of complex numbers can conduct to the misunderstanding of algebric algorithms.
In that specific case we're also going to cope through practices in workspaces. Building C.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
These lectures will live on for as long as linear algebra lives and so will Gil Strang. Now, that's some way to become immortal.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That reply is at "chinrxn"

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
How many lectures can you guys cover per week typically?

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's hard to begin with, but if you put in the effort every couple of days by doing exercises and reading up on it, watching this, doing your homework, Khan Academy, whatever you need - you will eventually get the hang of it. I think that doing Law essays and Scientific Research is much harder in reality. Don't worry =)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I've watched all his videos of 18.06 to study for my linear algebra finals and watching this video as last made me cry so much. It's really been my honor to say that I (sort of) am one of his students. Thank you professor

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
will read the notes to see what he left out on the proofs

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
mistake near 28:00 ----->  dy/dt = -2t     the position function starts as y= -t^2 so derivative should be negative for the dy/dt

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Probably the hardest class I'll take and probably the easiest for them.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Funny how the reason people like professors isn't even related to the subject they teach. Like this guy's chalkboard-erasing skills. Or the way Walter Lewin makes dotted lines.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
(28:13) Regarding the analogy with the center of gravity of a light rod with weights at discrete positions, if you'd like to visualize the balancing, the position marks should be further apart, 2 a unit to the right from 1, and 4 further two units to the right.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
3D blackboard!!!!!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Can my linear algebra teacher please learn to teach from you

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice to learn.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Let's go with integrals

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I'm not sure why everyone thinks he's such a great lecturer. Don't get me wrong, he clearly knows what he's doing and talking about, but here are my qualms with his teaching style:

1) He hesitates a lot. It makes it difficult (at least, it did for me) to follow his train of thought because he paused so often to consider and "reconsider" what he was going to say. I find it much easier to follow a lecturer when he or she has a straightforward, flowing style of presentation.

(See above for 2)

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Beautiful course

### 18. Properties of Determinants
he seems so much smarter at 1.5 speed lol. Watching at 1.5 I feel slow lol but at regular pace it feels like im learning along side him

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you for making these vids available, MIT! I'm taking calc II at my university in the Spring after a semester away from calculus, so I really appreciate being able to refresh my memory by "taking" a calculus course to prep! This professor is a lot more into proofs than the professor I had, so I'm even seeing familiar things in a new light. Thanks again! 

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Anybody studying this course nowadays?
I need some help

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This topic is so boring and easy. This is more suitable for the level of engineers. I don't know why it's a part of my mathematics course.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
fyi, for the curious: the sum of i squared with i from 1 to n is equal to n cubed divided by 3 plus n squared divided by 2 plus n divided by six.


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
q dira esta en ingles nooooo

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
dude it says his name at the beginning of each vid

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In 22:38 isnt the dF/dt a vector? Can anyone explain. Thank you

### 34. Final Course Review
스트랭 교수님 감사합니다ㅠㅠㅠ 딥러닝을 공부함에 있어 선형대수를 공부해두는게 많이 도움될꺼같아서 수강하기 시작했는데 이렇게 시간가는줄 모르고 재밌게 들을줄은 몰랐네요!  2005년 강의지만 아직도 이렇게 강의하시는분은 많지않은거같아요.  정말 전반적인 수학이 편하게 느껴지는거 같습니다 ㅠㅠ 한국에서도 이렇게 강의 다 찾아보는 학생이 있다는걸 알아주셨음 좋겠네요!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Asi empiezan, con cosas faciles despues te revientan el cerebro XD

### 25. Interactive Proof Systems, IP
Thank you so much. The material were so clearly articulated

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
The best


### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
46:31 Use the Cofactor Formula from the beginning.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I encourage anyone finding difficulty understanding this lecture to first visit Khan academy to see the proofs for the laws of logarithms and also to view the videos there about the formulas discussed here. (especially the definition of e and d/dx (ln x))

When I was first taking calculus I found this topic really hard to grasp (especially because my basics in logarithms was too weak). So what I did is that I first understood the properties of logarithms (from khan academy) by watching the proofs and then looked through the videos related to the formulas discussed in these lectures. Now when I see this lecture I feel it is a great lecture on this topic.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I'm British and you're totally right, MIT is one of the most distinguished University's in the world. No matter where you're educated, the initial lectures have to cater for a spectrum of ability. There will be people doing this as a requirement for their major which has no connection to hard science. Social science subjects need a grounding in this. The critics either never made it to college or are too young to know how the system works. 

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Or you could just use Steiner theorem for rotation around the point on the circumference, and do it in 10 seconds ;)

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The guy wrote the series wrong! The actual series should have been 1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16... And he cannot go any further than double the length of one block, measured from left end of the top block to the right end of the bottom block. And this means he would actually need infinitely many blocks to align the ends of the top and bottom blocks. So the guy actually couldn't pass the bottom block, it just seems like it from that angle. (Trust me, I solved this question in physics class in high school.)

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Zdalo sa mi že slnko ☀ ma svoju abecedu videl som písmenká a maľovanie a tuším aj zvuk písmenká  staré

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
It is crazy... really amazed... (tears drop)

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thanks

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
can someone shed a light on how is nds = <-f_x, -f_y , 1>dxdy @47:00

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Teşekkür ederim Dr. Strang. Eğlenceli bir eğitim oldu.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Then can i write error matrix as 1 - the projection matrix?

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Should we not use A0 = QR ,  A1=RQ => A0 = QRQ^-1 since we know Q is orthogonal and hence invertible? Where as R is not invertible unless A is?

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
The eigenvector calculation around  minute 33 confused me until I saw how the zero in row three gives an extra degree of freedom in choosing the vector. The check is to multiply by row 2. A nice trick.

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
bed finishing

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you MIT, thank you Mr. Strang, this is the way EVERYTHING  should be taught!!!

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
i am big Aylin

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why would someone dislike this?


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
the best professor on linear algebra and free class, you don't pay anything you get the best educated in the world, god bless America and the bad professors in the university should've think about themselves too, if they don't really like teaching and love students want to help students to make sense,they can always just leave, we have a lot of good professors looking for jobs!!!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
At 27:20 I have to guess the row since i don't wanna think so i took the row as [x,y,z] and then solve it manually to find that x+z = -3 will solve it. I thought i am so smart but..
...
...
At 37:40 I couldn't solve it using taking the variables although matrix P was an easy one to think but at time of lecture it seems hard but i guess it comes through practice

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would like to have a test, please tell me where I can find it :)

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Professor Strang mentions that U and V form bases for the four fundamental subspaces of A, but it's not clear to me how C(A) = C(Ur) and C(A') = C (Vr'). I know that U and V were determined by the eigenvectors of AA' and A'A, respectively, but how are these related to the column and row spaces of A?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
thank you MIT for open courseware


### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He's obviously French . 


### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
who else thinks that mistake was done deliberately

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Right hand rule 39:20

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you MIT and Gilbert Strang sir,you made my studies simpler

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]votre anglais est bon pour un francais!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Listening to him think his way through problems is the analytical education we need, and not just for algebra. His candor is well appreciated. He attacks very complicated ideas with a simple tongue. And in spite of all the newer technology, i am learning more from his approach than the newer educators.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
BEST MATHS TEACHER EVER SEEN..

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I WANT TO KNOW ALL THE MATH IN THE UNIVERSE!

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
cameraman sleeping?

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is confusing notation a feature or a bug in maths?..

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
"Well it takes approximately for ever to compute these determinants"!! Wow, such great sense of humour!!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is pure gold.

### 7. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma II: triangle removal lemma
Proof of TRL neglects edges inside clusters?

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Clear, concise, efficient, and most importantly doesn't make you take 1000 notes. Love his reviews to start off every lecture... sadly many professors are either too lazy, inept, or inefficient to spend time on review each class. I've watched many many math videos, and this Professor is probably the best math lecturer I am yet too hear. (Though Professor Leonard's calc series is wonderful as well.)

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you activate the subtitles, it changes it to "variety".

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
The ordinary light indirectly change because end phongsaly nod but a second energy. homely, godly drink

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
A statistics class focused on understanding statistics, not just scribbling equations.  Very refreshing.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I Really Like The Video Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices From Your

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 37:30 why we inserted the slope as 2y/x but not 2x? Since 2x is the slope of parabola

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
linear approximation is basically the equation of the tangent line at the point x0

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
free lectures. I  love M.I.T, love america. Does any country do like that?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
apparently i tested high on my IQ test in school. but watching this makes me feel dumb.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Glad I decided to go all the way back to basic LA, such a great and thorough review

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Thank you for posting this. These videos will allow me to pass my class!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
vector spaces of matrices! mindblow!

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The final review is very helpful, making me realize that my memory of some materials is already fading away a bit. So I went back for refreshing.  

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
"The job is to make some sense out of it." He is funny haha.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
It's extremely helpful , thank you sir.

### 3. Independence
How is P(AnB)=0 but P(A)*P(B)=1/12?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lol, I love being a high school junior, and doing this :D

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
My mind was blown two times  in just 45 minutes ❗❗🤯🤯

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He is very interesting

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
I respect the work you put into your videos. I find it truly disconcerting that all the major cryptocurrency YouTubers only look to pure waves and completely ignore the broader narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook may not be as optimistic as it seems. It's a bit irresponsible to ignore the fact that every ETF launch so far has caused a sharp spike in BTC's spike. Already on shaky ground with historically low volumes and nearly pure whale pumps, we narrowly avoided a long-term bear market. This is the worst time in history to invest as so many are not backing up their crypto assets. More attention should be paid to day trading as it is less affected by market unpredictability, ...

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks MIT i'm from Colombia, i really  appreciate it !!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This isnt exactly mathematical approach.. I see no theorems or proofs.. is this LinearAlgebra for physicist?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a guy; Boss+

### 12. Iterated Expectations
36:04 maybe it's worth mentioning that all E[Xi] are equal

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Prof Strang can be quite the comedian - that comment about Lewinsky was hilarious.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
"Whether the rest of the world will realize I was in danger or not, we don't know."  XD

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
"well I shouldn't do this, but I will." How many times has he said this in this course?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
someone needs to make a compilation of the students cheering for the professors erasing the blackboard!!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is seriously good stuff but I feel the lecturer glosses over a lot of nuances and could spend more time imparting intuition and abstract mathematical reasoning / techniques. Of course that would require twice the number of lectures.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
beautifully taught!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
SIGN BETWEEN    A.B   WILL ALSO BE POSITIVE IF  ANGLE THETA LIES BETWEEN 270 DEGREE TO 360 DEGREE( OPEN INTERVAL)   

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I'm literally binge watching these like a TV show. It's 03:15...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am absolutely in love with that accent

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
the audio is soooo low, guys

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Learning LA after graduation.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
fuck me...you guys in MIT do differentiation in your FIRST YEAR??

I have done differentiation in my 11th grade(high school in your region, I suppose)...MIT is easy shit...I suppose
god, MIT is slow...



### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Great teacher. I'm 76. He makes a potentially abstruse subject simple.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ around 7:30 how is he finding the vector PoP..? is it just subtraction of co ordinates from x,y,z and how does subtraction gives us the result ? what is the logic behind it ??

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
amazing lecture. loved it!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
he makes a comment in passing about doctors "getting tests results wrong", but his example about the radar doesn't readily translate into an example about medical testing. Even though a disease might be very rare, doctors don't just order a test for diseases at random. Drs order tests for a disease when a person has symptoms similar to those of others who have previously had the same disease. And so, even though celiac disease is suffered by less than 2% of the population, a patient for which celiac disease testing has been ordered will actually have a much higher chance of having it than a randomly chosen individual. While he's right the a priori chance of a random person having some rare disease is low, that same chance is much higher for a person that has been seen by a doctor and judged to be having symptoms of such rare disease.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
MIT Open Course ... WELL DONE.   Gilbert Strang   WELL DONE.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It was awesome to learn about the Jacobian. I've seen this here and there and never understood what it was. Thanks!!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
My mind got blown when I realized you could get the basis for the left null space from row transformation. I mean, it seems completely obvious after he points it out but I never thought much of it until then.

### 4. Counting
I like how the prof says factorial.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
He gives the vibes of mr. Mackay from south park. "Mkay? "😛
Haha, he is an amazing prof. Though. ❤️

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
i looking for lol buddy in euw, alingerte add me guys

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, this professor is so bad. The students already knowing this is the only way they'd get through.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished (17/03/21). To the exam!

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
 Never Seen someone like this.... Amazing!!!!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Why do we set the free variable to 1? What if we chose like 7 or 10 or any non zero value?

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
the pseudoinverse part is unclear, the book tells more details and it relationship with the normal solution

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why we have to write dx in an integral ??

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm brazillian, and I've been watching all the 18.02 lectures with Aurox as Instructor... And I can say that I am understanding every single word that comes out of his mouth. He's brilliant! Respect for him.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You have to learn calculus regardless of where you live...well I mean it depends on what kind of major you are going in to.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Now i can say i have a "strang" understanding of linear algebra

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For anybody wondering d/dy tan y = 1/cos^2(y) due to Cos^2(y)+Sin^2(y) being in the numerator of the answer. This is a trig identity that simplifies to one.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Your point? Not everyone has the luxury to have taken or even knew they wanted to take calc or above in high school

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Great lecture- thanks

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
He teaches the way mathematicians do math, lol.  It comes to him as he goes along.  Such a natural teacher. How I wish I had him...

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Graph and Tree are concepts used in Computer Science frequently

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
I think that choosing the distrib on Y is mostly done based on MaxEnt principle, not arbitrarily as said around 19:45.

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, wow and woowwww. 18:35 he really shows why we introduce this well known notation explicitly defining the constant variables. Never knew it had such a precise reason.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Audio channels fixed!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Diffrerentiation of logarithmic and exponential functions.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
you ate the best

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
My dreams come true. I just want to watch some lectures about functional analysis.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love this movie.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It does - there is a generalized Stoke's theorem of which the Divergence Theorem, Green's Theorem, Stoke's theorem as it appears here, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are all special cases. This generalized theorem works in any dimension!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a question to all the people talking about "how bad american education is", why does everyone from around the world want to come to MIT? Why are MIT graduates so succesfull?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
15:55 d|r|/dt does make sense to me: r is the position vector and it is a function r(t) of t; hence also |r| is a function of t and can be differentiated wrt t.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]sounds French

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lol that loud applause startled him a bit

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Emergency question! Can we describe a basis for non-subspaces? For example a plane doesn't go through the origin???

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Professor Strang: You have the amazing ability to bring out new rabbits out of old hats! Hats off!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much for posting !!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
for those who understand in one lecture, good for u but u will never really able to use it in real world application if u only understand cos u need to apply


### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Hello very good

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
how can we calculate that Expected value without actually finding distribution of that function? at 21:38

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Gradient, from functions to vectors.
Divergence, from vectors to functions.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why did MIT hire a paparazzi shoot OpenCourseWare video ?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Please tell me best books for linear algebra

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this actually isn't too bad

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Damn, I misread this. I thought this was the lecture on Dilbert space!

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
find someone who can explain it to you well. especially with calculus, the best thing to do is understand each topic conceptually first, then equations come next. 

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
wohooo, all makes sense now :D

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
11:15 who the fuck eats in a class and sits in a front row .

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Khan's all about giving intuition and nothing else.If you really want to learn then go for a complete university course and that's the way you should learn imo.I used to rely heavily on khan to buy some time and excuse which resulted in me FAILING IN MATH EXAM TWICE.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
.......id drop out


### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
8:18

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
So glad I came across this!! Thank you so much MIT!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Savage!!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Introduction to brain damages.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
It's my honor to have met you even virtually, sir!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the way he solved that limit at the end by using the derivative was absolutely brilliant : ) thx : D

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT professors. Thank you MIT so much. Such a wonderful job. I really appreciate it. 

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT


### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Hug you , professor. Thanks a lot.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
God bless Linear Algebra 🙏thanks y'll guys

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Protip: Only listen to the right earbud.

### 12. Iterated Expectations
Great teacher!  he explained many concepts in Statistics far much better than my previous learned, cleared out many doubts.  I'm following his series also.  Only this Lecture 12 I'm not full understanding yet, need more practice.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think I have a pretty good basic on that deteminant = area thing since we were just talking about it in my linear algebra class :D

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I am currently a software engineer in 3rd year. I watched a couple of these lectures back in first year when I was taking linear algebra and found it extremely confusing because that was my introduction and these lectures expect you to know the basics. Now that I know the basics and am currently reviewing what I've already been introduced to, these lectures are super insightful.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Thanks again Prof Strang.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When differentiating the sine and cosine functions, he mapped delta x to 0 on the first term, and 1 on the second term. How does this work?

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Gram-Schmidt portion of the lecture begins at 26:07 for anyone only interested in that

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
padma laxmi is hot

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]So the thing that's happening here is that he's not finding the area of a circle, he's finding the volume of a region above a surface that 'looks' like a circle. What he plots there is the base of the surface, which is where you get your bounds of integration from.

If he was finding the area of a circle, the double integral of r*dr*dø with those bounds would indeed be correct and would yield pi/4 because the formula for the circle would be sqrt(x^2+y^2) = r = 1.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome video series

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Dr. Strang. I have greatly enjoyed these lectures I hope they have prepared me for taking Linear Algebra in the fall. I'm a 21 year old from Iowa City, Iowa and I attend The University of Iowa.

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
Argh... who da fook hires cameraman, that has no mathematical backgroud!..

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
is this the full course? thank Prof.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Boost your knowledge of core engineering subjects here 💯🇺🇲

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
U need to improve the voice quality like the first one .

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
God bless MIT!!!❤

### 16. Markov Chains I
in r11 column after two transitions the value should be .225 not .35... @34.50minutes

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Are partial derivatives related to PDEs in the same way that derivatives are related to ODEs? I know about a semester's worth about ODEs, and so I assumed that the relation between derivatives and ODEs was the same as with partial derivatives and PDEs. I don't really know anything about PDEs though.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
bitch that's what i thought; too bad i finished this class last semester

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
This is just amazing, how much you appreciate this lecture largely depends upon how much you paused during the previous ones.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
the best maths teacher ive come across!

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't get it about  the deeper understanding about radians! :(

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
The part I found confusing is when we write [I F]*[-F,I] = 0 F and -F are the same dimension but the identity on the left hand side is rxr and on the right hand side (n-r)x(n-r),

Thinking it through, it makes sense. The RHS has the same number of columns as the number of free variables. It's just a little unusual to see the same letter on both sides meaning slightly different things.

### Lecture 14: Limits of Functions in Terms of Sequences and Continuity
For the proof that built on why lim x goes to 0 that sin(1/x) does not exist, isn't that is applying the fact that sin(1/x) is a continuous function hence convergent sequence will be mapped into a convergent sequence under this mapping hence we have he contradiction?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
7:51. Really good question.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is wrong with most of you commentators?  If you are too smart or too good for these lectures then go somewhere more challenging.  No need to show off how smart you are by stating how simple the work is for you.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
this guy reminds me of Donald Duck

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Sir here along which vector u are taking projection u have specified nothing

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did I end up here? X_X

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I love how you can reach the same answer also using a calculus approach.. and I LOVE the two pictures for the least squares regression. Beautiful stuff and amazing lecturer.

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Gram-SchmidtOrthonormalization.html

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you soo much for making me see vectors as a reality!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Fibonacci numbers being solved for as an algebraic equation with linear algebra was pretty cool.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Camera man is so professional

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
13:30 don't tell me the flat-Earther are at MIT now..!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
das hab ich mit 16 in der 10 klasse gelrnt..das gechillteste was es gibt :D

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
square shaped system with non-zero numbers in main diagonal (pivot position) and only zeros below diagonal. above the diagonal you can have any numbers you want.


### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Few comments:-
(1) As a mathematician I never referred to sign change in a function when taking derivative order two as concave up or down - the way I learned and always described to other people was as concave or convex function.

(2) At minuet 44:00, I noticed in few occasions saying the range of the function instead of domain when the intervals were written on the black board. Furthermore 0 < x < e^2 is the same as 0 < x < e and hence the confusion later on with points of inflection when in fact it should have been said that: in the interval 0 < x < e (subset of the entire domain) the function is decreasing since df^2 is less than zero and then from e < x < +infinity, the function is increasing since df^2 is greater than zero.

Apart from these issues, the lecture is very good.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What are the Prerequistics for learning this course.Please tell me. I want to learn this and also tell the reference book for it.Please tell me

### Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space
if  A  is surjective  then the range of  A  is closed. because  it is  equal to  H.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:40 wtf is it halloween

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
How do u get (1 2 3 1) with a zero row (0 0 0 0) and (1 0 1 1)

u said u reserve the steps..

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Can someone help me with a math test I really need help please

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lecture!!!

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
These students don't know how lucky they are sitting in that classroom. Perhaps a future research  person sits there who perhaps by standing on the shoulders of past gifted people will help find a cure for some of these dreadful diseases from learning how to apply his way of thinking. Courses such as these train young minds for concepts that will challenge them when they become age 30 and beyond with a a decade or more of real life knowledge. All you youngsters this is your wake up call, BEGIN!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
The goat no cap

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Ez

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
Wonderful lecture

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
So if col 3 = col 1 + col 2, then x=[1 1 0] and x = [0 0 1] produce the same vector b, which is what - a paradox?  Alternatively, you can't reduce 3-2 to 0 without also reducing 3-3 to 0.    I know that happens thru elimination.  Not yet seeing why that follows logically from col 3 = col 1 + col  2.  But it means z can only equal 0, so the column space can't fill R3.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I actually finished the course. Thank you so much OCW

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
28:35

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Love him so much.

### 9. Reducibility
A is reducible to co-A implies that Atm is reducible (general) to co-Atm. Is this really the case?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
damn subtitle, my exam is in a couple of days and I need to watch this seriously, but the subtitle just keeps making me giggle ^^haha

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Such cool stuff.

### 34. Final Course Review
This was amazing, thank you so much for all of the content made available for everyone!

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lecturer!

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
These MIT math professors have their shit together. 

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
13:20 course start

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Helped to understand

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
indian ascent is much more clear and understandable then this.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Keep your crap out of videos like this. You're really going to spam MIT math lectures? Nut.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I like your content of sharing your knowledge about statistics...hope my channel would also benefit from this channel by following you. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYiQ3ujdiWfpi3LZhM4Do_Q

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This is truly golden knownledge. Gilbert Strang is incredible. I love this linear algebra course so much

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Strang if a gift from God ❤️

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture answered my whole life question which noone answered me
Thank u mit ❤️

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've been watching these lectures and this is my favorite so far. To finish with the numerical calculation of the "mystery number" e was brilliant.

### 13. Regression
This goes to show that you can be a brilliant person but a crap teacher.

MIT or not I'm going to stick with Khan Academy.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why is it that f is taken as X^2 + Y^2 and not something else?

### 34. Final Course Review
i think the whole course took me from 1.5 to 2 months to complete it (im first high school i barely knew what a matrix is) and i cant believe how awesome the whole course i just want to say thanks 
im studying this so i work in the ai field and i know how to compute all of this using python (learned programming first) and what i can do now is pretty incredible now two more courses to finish before university 
single and multi variable calculus
THX MR.GILBERT STRANG<3

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT for making these lectures publicly available. Will always be grateful to you. One day I will make sure (if not certainly,but will try to) to get my PHD. from you.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much for this amazing course!!!

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow i am glad that i go to a university where they give the notes after the class because i would not be able to copy ALL of that.
i would get flustered and throw my pencil.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is awesome. That column picture analysis is new to me. Great lecture my dude

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the definition of saddle point?

### 16. Markov Chains I
This is amazing!

I studied chemistry at university few years ago, and that definition of Markov Chains really makes me think of what we did with the equilibrium of the reactions with the different molecules. This is exactly the same kind of definitions: the different states are our different molecules, the probabilities have exactly the same role as our "reaction speed", and the conclusion is the same: the equilibrium is unique for a given system.
Actually during the lecture I was trying to guess just from the diagram what the equilibrium would be hahaha.



I feel sad that we were not even given a mention about markov chains back then.


I was struggling with the last 3 lectures in this course, and even more in the assignments, but I'm so happy to see these descriptions I am already intuitively familiar with that my pain just flew away!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can somebody tell me why at 7:50 the second ∆x tends to 1 and not zero please ?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
At 44:40 the girlfriend broke up with the guy with the cell phone or the class was too hard  to understand?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
The akward moment when free knowledge is given and you complain about quality of video

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love his accent!! =D By the way, he teaches well too!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is really an exellent teacher, wonderful class

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
He's  still wearing the same shirt, has the same humor, same energy and 15 years have passed. This guy is just amazing.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I was expecting more from this lecture. Nevertheless ready for the next lecture on eigen value and eigen functions.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
这个老头教的不错

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thought it was Jimmy Dore for a second in the thumbnail.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Me after reading that class was empty, 😲

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
25:05

### Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem
He is slow but packs a punch all the way to the end of the lecture.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do we do square deviation, but not ordinary one? I don`t understand the precondition for squares. If anyone can explain, do it, please.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm so confused. Do MIT students go to each lecture multiple days per week since each lecture in this playlist is only an hour long, compared to the standard 3-hour long class in other colleges and what I've read about them, and the professor seems to say goodbye after each of his lectures ends.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Magic

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pretty sure he's French !

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It's feeling like I m in MIT and great respect for prof.Strang

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yo creo que con que subir los videos ya estan haciendonos un favor. Ademas su ingles es re claro, asi que no deberia ser un problema el entenderlos. Soy de Bolivia, por si te interesa para compartir algo de esta materia, mira que esta buenisima.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This teacher is so amazing.. thank you!

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
One thing in question in the lecture is that Ui but not Vi is in the column space of A. Vi should be in the A's row space.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
thanks a lot :

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
A great lecture showing us the wonderful secret behind linear algebra

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
watch this at x2

### 4. Counting
''HHHrwhhhaat is the sum.'' Great lecture.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent video Professor

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He looks like Mr. Earnie from my 10th year. He was cool.

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Can one of you "smart" "engineers" please learn how your great grandparents or older could make machines without gas or batteries. Like wind up or something. The globe is almost out of gas because "smart" or "intelligent" people are still drooling over something simple someone said over almost 100 years ago. I understand it's your religion. However can someone please aim for some progress.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
The video series is a great and fast review of linear algebra.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i loved it!

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
.4

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
We know that the first three rows of A form a loop. So, the rank of the matrix should be 2, right? We know that there are maximum 2 rows that are independent in A. Please explain.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where did M(e)=1 come from?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I agree Sprang is great but you could have recognized the golden ratio 1/2(sqrt5 +1) and every mathematician knows this number. It's like being baffled if someone tells you pi equals 3,14159265....

### 34. Final Course Review
Thoroughly enjoyed these lectures, much easier to understand than my lecturers in college. Thank you Professor Strang!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
how would the shape look like for p, 1<p<2

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Is x^t*y a 1-D matrix or a number?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I want to use chalk.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just the best.... MIT lov it



### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Love....

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Can someone please explain to me, Why do we get all the Null space of A just by taking all the combinations of only two special solutions. What is the proof of this?. Shouldn't we take all possibilities of special solutions.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
(note for myself)
. If v is a column vector, is v^T times v a 1x1 vector or a number(scalar)?
. Can a 1x1 matrix be treated like a number? What about the commutative law?
. The fact that "1x1 matrix is isomorphic to a number" means they're interchangeable in math equations?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
@[USERNAME]
I think they are actually the same, because LAMBDA is a diagonal matrix, you can have a try.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I just started loving physics after seeing your lecture

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing explanation! 

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
can anyone explain how the 5th column of w8 came out to be?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
where are the online programming assignments ?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
many thx for these wonderful resources out there

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Prof Strang spoke so much about errors and he did make one ! :P

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is a great series and I've learnt so much from it. But if anyone (like me) is a little bit confused about maxima, minima, saddle point and why they can be calculated that way, here's some amazing videos from Khan Academy that'll definitely help you out:
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/optimizing-multivariable-functions-videos/v/multivariable-maxima-and-minima

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
17:26 "That 7 is no accident...that 11 is no accident..." And I live over a 7-11...spooky, Dr. Strange.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This fellow makes things crystal clear.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There are three typographical errors on the notes that I just want to point out, in Fig. 3. The scant line from (-1/2,1/2) to (0,1)  in the notes it says (1,0). If you work out the slope (y2-y1/(x2-x1) it comes out right if the points are (-1/2,1/2) and (0,1)
The same error is repeated in the actual figure, the y-intercept should be (0,1) and not (1,0)
The last typo is on page 4 in a both in the center it say e^x = w it should read e^w =x as is correctly expressed 5 lines after. 



### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For any x=e^n, it is clearly possible to know the value of Ln(x), which is n. For a particular case when n=o, therefore Ln(e)^0=0. 
I am just saying that the teacher should not say that x=1=e^0 is the only number we can know for sure the value of Ln(x).

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much, Prof. Strang and MIT for making the linear algebra (straight) and simple.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
...one of the best lectures I ever had.
...and I've out of school for tens years.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
From this lecture,  I understand Singular Value  Decomposition in linear algebra. Dr. Strang really   explained this topic  and the examples very well.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
already know all of this from school

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hahaha, "33:33 This orgy of greek letters"

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
It is very sad to see Professor turning older and older. He is a great teacher!

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
Shouldn't He have multiplied the 0.3 by sigma=sqrt[373] around 18:40 ?

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Great lecture gilbert strang.. 
You are my saviour for final exams. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
good video, good explanation, good fun

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys about the problem on 16:12 , the integrand fuction  is continious for both x = <0  and x>0  so  i assume domain of the integrand fuction is R-0 (there was no other restrictions) but  the undoing trig sub part  (24:21) he assumed theta is <90 so that solution works for x=positives.Did he solve that problem for only x >0 or somehow its related with x<0 too but im missing it ?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is amazing!!!!!!!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Greetings from New York City!

Prof. Strang was my Linear Algebra 18.700 professor during my sophomore year at MIT in Spring 1973.  I loved his teaching style, did well on the tests, and received an “A” in the class.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
hey um..., for some reason i cant watch any of the video in the web site you posted here. Whenever i click on the video icon it just loads but never get there.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
17:46 "Math starts counting with one and electrical engineers start counting at zero. Actually, they're probably right."

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Believe me it's really helpful.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]so schwer kommt mir das auch nicht vor und ich bin 10. real :D

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
One thing that I find confusing is that because the sigma matrix is left multiplied by V transposed, it is not pure scaling. This is because the sigma values are multiplied by the rows of V transposed and not the columns. This will cause additional rotation and changes in dimensionality.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The corn field explanation blew my mind! Thanks, now I understand vector fields!

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Good. But I wish proof was given

### 25. Classical Inference III
Thankyou professor

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you very much, Professor Gilbert Strang. You are a legend of linear Algebra.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
love this course

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Dr. Stranglove or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Numerical Linear Algebra"

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
@3:30, why is he omitting the sigma scalars (singular values) in this sum of left & right singular vectors to produce X? Is that right?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
the least viewed lecture of the entire series :D This is a hard topic. Thank you, Professor Strang.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where can I see the solutions to the problem sets? Thanks!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Wow, this is just awesome!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much, dear Professor Strang, all TA's, the camera personnel, and all other supporting staff. Started learning this course about ten years ago. After graduating from my program and working now, I finally managed to finish watching and reading the lecture notes. The whole system of linear algebra shown in this course is so beautiful. Will go through the exercise, problems, and exams also, all necessary steps to refresh memories and memorize essential details. Will continue to finish  Professor Strang's Highlights of Calculus, differential equation, and three other linear algebra courses. You are a blessing to humanity, Professor. God bless you and your family.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh.. my god.. the board and chalk are phenomenal..!

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
this is the last, im sad, because these lessons are great, thank you ! I proceed ...

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you so much sir, your effort in this age

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Man, this guy is soo much better than my own prof.. It's just that he's able to explain ideas much more clearly and at a reasonable pace! 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
In the minute 10:20 the teacher talks about a third method to multiplicate matrices. It should be multiplying every row of A by all the columns of B, isn't it? I didn't get it at all. If someone knows I'll read haha.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
At the end I remembered I never read about fourier transform only fourier series. Thought I was going insane for a second.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
every math loving student would love this great man

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
By far, Denis Auroux has explained the lecture really well, and it has really been helping me out with the application of 3 by 3 det. to find equations of planes. Thanks for providing these free videos M.I.T.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India
http://www.wellesleypublishers.com/buy.html

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best professor ever seen.... Wish my dumb prof is like him mate

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
awsome lecture i think i'm falling inlove with maths......


### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
equation @ 33:07  i.e.  E32(E21A)=U  ;that might be wrong bcoz I multiplied to get LHS which is not equal to RHS =U .
please help I can't figure out what is wrong.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Nothing is broken - go to the URL link get the lecture slides , get the HW assignments and everything you need to understand what is going on is there. Phillipe Rigollet is excellent and discusses with ease fairly complicated material. Excellent job. My two complaints are that the sound volume is a way too low - whoever recorded the first lectures did lousy job. Also the slides are not properly exported to pdf - there are some missing math  symbols in some of the equations

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you for the wonderful lectures. 
I didnt catch, if dimension of column space is same as rank of matrix. By doing row operation, Row space seems to be the same, but the column space changes. How do we know that the dimension of column space of row reduced matrix is same as the original matrix?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what if someone fart

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
(note for myself)  23:46) if the two eigenvalues are complex numbers, they'll be conjugates of each other(sum becomes a real number).
31:47, 33:26) Search what 'matrix exponential' is. It's *NOT* just a simple notation of element-wise exponential operation.
* Also note that this lecture does *not* cover  the entire rigorous mathematical proofs, as well as other lectures of Prof. Strang (At least this series of Linear Algebra lectures so far).
* The solution using "matrix exponential" notation (31:55) can be understood if you see 44:30, given the Taylor series of the matrix is the _'definition'_ of the matrix exponential notation.

### 14. Graph limits I: introduction
Thanks!!! Excelent. Is there a text book about this?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I really like his teaching. Perfect.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I love when he's building up to property 3.  You can tell how excited he's getting (adjusting his hair, taking little pauses).  Very cute

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
47:56

can someone explain to me how he got f'(Xo) ?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I'm liking these videos a lot, but I admit that if this was my first introduction to Linear Algebra, I would  be confused. I have already had a LA course before, and these videos are just great for me to think about things differently and connect the concepts in different ways. Have had a few "aha!" moments with things I only did mechanically before.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Audio starts at 1:14

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
"si alguien se animara a traducirlo..."

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
still don't understand however i feel that i need to do some e.g.'s and i'll get there..
great lecture regardless

### 34. Final Course Review
I watched all 36 videos of linear algebra. DR. Strang you are an amazing and a ionic professor at MIT. I  really learn linear algebra from watching these videos  and doing problems from different linear algebra textbooks. I watched all your videos from 18.085 and 18.086., however linear algebra is the best. I will be watching the rest of your videos on linear  algebra. DR. Gilbert Strang, thank you so much for all your contribution to advanced mathematics.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A random thought on the string problem-- y'(x_0)=0 because it minimizes the total mechanical energy (mgy=min; lagrangian mechanics). Also, don't confuse x_0 which makes y'(x_0)=0 possible with the variable x, as the former is just a random value for the lowest point on that elliptical curve.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy loves telling really really subtle jokes.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know this is math From India

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand how David Jerison can take the natural log of a negative number, the domain of the function doesn't exist for negative numbers. Am I missing something?

### 3. Independence
A probability paradox?
If I construct the sample space in this way: E1= king boy & king's sibling boy, E2= king boy & king's sibling girl, it would seem that the probability of E2 is 1/2. 
But if I construct the sample space in this way: E1'= BB, E2'= BG, E3'= GB, E4'= GG, it seems the probability that the king's sibling is a girl is 2/3.
But only in the second case can I assume all events are equiprobable: E1 can happen in just one way; E2 can happen in two: E2 = E2'UE3'.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Terrible

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great lecture! Thank you, Professor Strang!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Does anyone know why we write only "1" for the value of "I" (identity) in the final matrix of this video? The equation was that x=c[-F ; I]. Why do we plug in a vector of F but only a scalar of I?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Couldn't the commentary at 30:19 about 'quarter' lead to some misunderstanding about cardinality of R^2?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Why he wrote f(-1,0)?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
lol he doesnt explain shit worst lecture ever,waste of time

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks professor for these amazing lectures.  
I would like to give a suggestion- please write the name of topic in the description/thumbnail, so it will be easy for us to find the specific lecture.
By the way 😊 Thanks again for the lecture. ❤❤

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My class uses stewart's multivariable calculus and I don't like that book. These videos and ostebee's multivariable calculus make me one of the best in class.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Finally! Where did you end up finding this??? Cached in someone's IE?

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
This is what we learn in 4 classes of same length

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
This guy is objectively the best teacher btw.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Tt want to be yur students whom already been MIT University.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
43:41 Columns 1 and 3 don't form a basis, though? They span the subspace but are not independent? Column 1 can be found in column 3?

Wait, but no combination of 1 and 3 will ever cancel each other out, so their nullspace is only the zero vector. I would have made a major mistake if I didn't catch that, damn.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The class is great, but can you add English subtitle on it? It will be easier for people from non-English area.😀

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Greek professor!!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love you mit

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Perfect lecture 👌👌

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I had to pause to figure out how he got the eigenvectors at the end. Plugging in Phi works but it wasn’t until I watched again that I noticed he was pointing to the lambda^2-lambda-1=0 relationship to reveal the vector.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Great lecture. Thanks Prof. Strang. Thanks MIT.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Absolutely incredible. All of my teachers tried to explain this over the course of 3 class periods, keep in mind my classes only have 20 students. He accomplished a thorough, easy to follow explanation in 30 minutes. Absolutely incredible teacher.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Great lecture.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
in the discussion of the falling pumpkin, the average speed should, i feel, actually be the average velocity since there is a sign in front of the numerical answer. i think he just forgot to mention that. anywho, nice vid

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is Analytical Maths,in short the analysis moves from variable and ends at the clarity of the function.....

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is boss...Great Lecture !

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] It's because not all of the students pay all of that $50K (that's what it is now). About 85% of the students receive some sort of grants  from MIT. In order to maintain and make sure that future students will get those those scholarships they need donations.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I cried a bit when I saw the inverse appeared in the augmented part of the matrix @40:51.  Dang this is beautiful

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow actually explaining where rdrd(theta) comes from.........

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
That's because you suck at this.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
26:37 this is for those who did not understand the first reasoning behind why the inverse was not possible.
A=[1 3;2 6]  
X is supposed to be the identity matrix so that A^-1A=I
You can approach it this way:
A*(1st col. of X)= [1;0]
which is same as 
1st col. of A* X11+ 2nd col of A*X12
but the problem is that since the first column and second column of A are dependent vectors (that is [1;2] and [2,6] differ only in length and not in the direction. It's impossible that a linear combination of them can result in a vector that has a different slope (as is [1;0])
I hope this helps.

Pretty bad proof for the product rule. The u's and v's are really confusing and his second step wasn't explained well. If you want a good proof, watch Khan Academy's proof for the product rule. Makes a lot more sense.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Im kind of disappointed to see that at no point during this did he make the connection between WHY the integral from a to b of f(x) equals its antiderivative of F(b)-F(a). Basically, why does the area under the curve only appear to depend on its end points? this always confused me during calculus, because the answer isnt very obvious, but its stunning whats you see the conneciton. using riemann sums as well, at some number b-a/n as n goes to infinity. 

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
25:00. That is definitely *not* a proof of the chain rule. Don't be misled into thinking so.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
at 31.20 when making the columns orthonormal by dividing by 1/2 , F4 should also be divided and the new matrix 1/2(F4) is orthornormal. Then the new matrix and its hermitian are equal to the Identity, which means F4^H x F4 = 4I. Right?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
My high-school professor never solved it via variables all the way to -1/(Xo^2). He went to the point of showing the
Xo - (Xo ΔX)
ΔX
and then showing how inserting numbers would cancel out the delta.

### 23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
It is mentioned that "phi is known positive value" (16.28 min). I am wondering,  if exponential dist. comes under canonical exponential family (or not), where theta = lambda, b(theta) = ln(theta) and phi = -1?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Largest hall on our planet! with largest blackboard and several! Where and how many students😂

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice video

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
BEAST!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]tan^(-1)(x) is a very common notation for arctan(x), I see it used all the time. Ever seen a Texas Instruments graphing calculator?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
yeah... why do u think that happen?

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
I think the last problem is incomplete: the sum is not always a projection matrix because if A was -I or I then the sum is not a proyection matrix but either 0 or the identity. I and -I are both symmetric and orthogonal.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thank you professor for this excellent lecture.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
my calculus 3 professor taught us,  think of a saddle point as a point on a "pringles chip" a lot of people know exactly what it looks like.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
one of the best teacher in the world thank you professor Gilbert Strang  god bless u

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]the clapping was classic first time i heard applause in a calculus class

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
"You start from the origin and you blow up the norm until you get a point on the line that satisfies your constraint, and because you are blowing up the norm, when it hit first, that's the smallest blow up possible, that's min, that's the guy that minimize" (31:23-31:42) that's 2-D optimization in a nutshell...clear and simple, thanks very much Professor Strang..

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
OMG ITS THE THERAPIST FROM ANIMANIACS

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Long live your kindly,mild professor

### 4. Pushdown Automata, Conversion of CFG to PDA and Reverse Conversion
Anthropomorphizing the machine

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To all of the people saying that American schools suck, they don't, not that much anyway.  I'm American, and I learned this in high school too.  The thing is that MIT is very forgiving about what background each student has, since some American schools (inner city) actually do suck.  I guarantee 18.06 (linear algebra) and 18.100C (Topology, Real Analysis) are way, way above anything taught in secondary school anywhere in the world.  Please note the ".01" in the title.  This is a day one course.

### 3. Independence
the lecture is awesome but my head started spinning now!!!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there a special channel for Professor de is auroux??

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Que exageracion de PUNTOS

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
16:53

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I love the sarcasm of his voice in 27:50  "In case you care" xd

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
❤️ thank You so much ❤️... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why am I watching this ...

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
37:03 No BADBADNOTGOOD ?? lol

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
WOW🥺 I am not at all a math person, I just like watching these videos because it’s fascinating how smart people are. I understand nothing this professor is saying. This is about as far over my head as the moon is.  Amazing.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how is d/dx (x^2+y^2=1) = 2x+2yy' = 0 ? everything is clear except y', where does it come from?

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Because it's over the unit circle.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
you have to respect this man 🙏

### Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem
Good use of Zorn's Lemma on expansion.

### Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras
Plz upload complex analysis.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Who the fuck still uses a blackboard in this day and age? Someone as absolutely legendary as this guy. Old school is best school.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is MIT freshman math - all students in all departments are taking it and the next level of treatment starting 2nd year gets into the real meat.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Great video,  but there is a big error.
6:13
"Do I have a subspace if I take all the vectors on the plane and all the ones on the line? No."
False. In general you don't have a subspace, but it depends, sometimes you have one.
The correct answer would be "If the plane contains the line yes, otherwise no", another correct answer would be "in general no". 
But answering just "No" you are implicitly saying "Always no" which is false and incorrect.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This man is extremely clear, excellent lecture!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thank you for sharing the excellent lectures. 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To much time wasted writing on Chalkboard.   He could have written everything on the boards Before class and then faced the class and explained it.  Much time would be saved.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
how is he "cheating" at 6:50 ? i've taken physics before but not sure what small details he's talking about

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
35:46 Something about the exam also a review of this unit

### 11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit
At 59:57 defining the Brownian bridge, I believe there might be an error. An expectation of R.V's can't have a distribution. Therefore, I think he may have meant X_t | X_S ~N(0,t-s) instead of the expectation.

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
23:30 Is this supposed to be "A" instead of "dA" on the LHS ?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
34:13 is a beauty

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a math degree and I still enjoy these lectures. Auroux is a great lecturer.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
e^At does not converge as t tends to infinity....why does he say that?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Which book is used in this series. Or is there preferred book

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Newton rocks!

### 15. Regression (cont.)
Thank you for the lectures!!! Please, add the 16th lecture.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
is it possible that i didn't get anything because i do not know physics

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Amazing

### Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences
nothing makes me happier than seeing Dr. Casey Rodriguez eating a cookie and drinking a can of liquid

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I have a question, do we have to solve the psets by hand, or are we allowed to use a program like sagemath?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Very Good Content !!!!!!!

🤙👌💪

👏👏👏👏👏👏

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
(y)

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
At 4:43 , why does he divide x= (aT b)/(aT a) ? Those are matrices, and I always thought that it is not possible to divide a matrix by a matrix, that was the reason as to why we instead multiply by the inverse but not divide?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished the whole Single Variable course. This really helped me put all these pieces of knowledge on calculus I got in high school together. Professor Jerison is the best teacher I ever had.
Thanks to MIT OCW for this opportunity!
Russia, 2016.

### 3. Parametric Inference
I've watched the first 3 videos so far and I find it's not easy to follow the professor. It looks like I should read through all the slides before coming back to the videos..

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
“I’m sorry for teaching you algebraic theory”

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’m in engineering and still, this is too advanced for me, and most of my classmates. God, this is a great opportunity to learn. Thank you so much MIT!

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:48 Albegra 😂

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
the hall needs more chalk boards

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is my understanding correct? That we are solving for the volume under z = exp[–(x^2+y^2)] and above the z = 0 plane? If yes, then I'm not sure why the professor avoided mentioning this. I guess it is because he didn't want to make the problem seem like a problem in multivariable calculus. Nonetheless, I think it would have made the discussion clearer.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It took me 15 seconds to realize that he was speaking English! 

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
We ask owl selves, in a given dilection, a vectill

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Thank you Prof.Strang 🇨🇳

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Sorry to break it to you, Strang, but you've lost me at this point. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
are you saying that this lecturer looks like Linear Algebra??? 

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Can't wait for our classes to end so that I can binge watch lectire series.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
First time I ever see an explanation on why we have y_general = y_particular + y_homogeneous, which somehow makes everything make sense.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
13:11 "those give you junk; they give you an extra factor of ln2". Actually I think they give you an extra factor of 1/ln2. Proof:
(log2p)'=(lnp/ln2)'=(1/ln2)*(p'/p)

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
woohoo integration by parts...how exciting...reminds me of the lecture I had a week ago!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...

This guy is awesome! Really enjoy the lectures.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I do not understand the fact that why the summation of expected values gives mean?? Could u please help Thanks in advance.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I don't want to write down a big definition, you can see what it is." 
how much we need teachers like this.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
so far the examples given for subspaces are all n+1 * n matrix. How comes that? Is it just a coincidence or does the 'missing' column represents zero vector?

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
lol i watched the entire playlist just for this video

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
50:00 the important/biggest/principal part of matrix

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
we only live so long...lol, amazing professor!!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
well... How old are these students ?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
30:25 I had to pause for a bit and take a deep breath

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
35:55 Size of identity matrix should be be nxn so that its conformable, shouldn't it?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Gracias.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
god bless gilbert strang
and also thanks to MIT for putting them on  the web
what on earth  did we do before the internet  ?

### Lecture 23: The Dirichlet Problem on an Interval
He builds to the adjoint for trivial means. Well done.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
why are  free variables with value 1 and 0 so special?

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy is awesome

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Can we have access to programming assignments made for this course?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hlo sir 
 My question is that 
Why we use exponential

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone explain why he add OA,AB,BP and get OP?
And why AB is < 0 ，a>?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
18:04 and 28:12 
It proves Prof. Strang is a man of his words.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I'm unclear about the following statement 04:21 "[Singular] means [matrix A] takes some vector X into zero". I know if matrix A is singular, it means matrix A cannot be inverted. However, I don't understand how multiplying vector X by a singular matrix A will result in zero. I was wondering if anyone can help me understand this.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Voice ❤️

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I undersand now why American suck in math damm
 (Yes I'm French)

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Camera guy if you're reading this, please keep camera on the board and stop following the professor unless he is physically making demonstration


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is so bad ....

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you are good teacher ever i have seen so keep it up


### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have been thinking about the geometric proofs but i just can not visualize them , it has been many hours but i fail to comprehend the geometric proofs. Although i can say that the 2nd proof was a bit more feasible, but the first proof; especially the one which is related with A ( d/dx sinx = cosx ) is just nightmare.. 

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
One of the silver linings for covid. Thanks.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Not under CC license 🤔

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Inverses --> add 3 times of row 1 to row 2::: Doesn't make row 2 as 3 1 0 it makes it 0 1 0

Row -1 --> 1 0 0
Row -2 --> -3 1 0
3 times row -1 ..> 3*1 0*3 0*3  --> 3 0 0
add above row to row 2 -3+3 1+0 0+0 --> 0  1  0

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
To find this course on the web is tantamount to finding massive gold treasure.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Now this helps me realise my mistakes in A level which I don't know before ... Amazing n good lecture solidly explained those tables n rules will surely help much

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy8Jcwl2YnU&t=7s

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Hi, relative to undergraduate curriculum, would this be considered Intermediate Statistics / Statistics II, following an intro-level college stats class? Thanks!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Just like Lil Pump taught... B rows B rows B rows B rows B rows....

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
That's some nice handwriting.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof. Auroux is awesome,,what a style

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
5:08 - Therefore, every King should have his two Queens.  ;-)  Totally logical to me.  Or perhaps Q is the queen that's a lady by day, and Q-transpose is the queen who's on her back.  :-|
   
Sorry guys - couldn't resist.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
The proof is so obvious it yells "RAR!" at you 🤓

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
sorry but not sorry 38:25

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
love how many small extra's he throws in constantly, as small "notes" to know ^^ keeps the mind awake and entertained in wonder :D
wish my professors was as invested in their lectures :)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
3:10
A is the matrix of coefficients
6:23 
The line of solutions to this equation
23:44
26:00 big picture
29:30 multiplying a matrix by a vector. AX

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
In many linear algebra courses that I have seen, the student is simply told about the various relationships between the fundamental subspaces. But in this course these ideas are convincingly yet accessibly presented. This is very important because it allows students to really understand such key ideas of linear algebra to the point where they become intuitive, instead of simply memorizing properties and formulas. Another great lecture by professor Strang!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
that's was amazing.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
This video was recorded on a Saturday and I am watching it on a Saturday. The Professor caught me off guard when at the end, he said, "have a great weekend. See you on Monday"

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
What an amazing lecture, thank you!

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
12:11  similar matrices
31:10 Jordan Form

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I believe Prof. Strang deliberately made the mistake at the end of Lec 9, in order to transition the focus from column space to row space. The transition was too smooth for this to be an accident. This is also a great show of humility that he didn't mind being perceived making a mistake!

### 4. Counting
explanations of counting is great by a geneous  prop...

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
This is MIT. Great lecture

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Well I don't think I'll be humbled because in 6 months time I will have reached a higher level of Linear Algebra than MIT undergrads (actually doing a maths project in coorporation with my high school and a local university, in april I'll be finished.. L.A. is not exactly tough compared to other fields of maths).

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Can someone explain why the computatinal expense is roughly 100^2 for the first step? I thought it would be roughly proportional to n = 100

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
interesting topic, he is a good teacher for sure

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
You should really rerecord the previous 5 classes with functions on the place of numbers and call it tensor calculus - introduction

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Beautiful... lovely..

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys i am 18 years old and i am learning some of that stuff at school right now... I am sure that they learn more advanced things there but it's alitle strange :/ Shouldn't all that be supposed to be known??

### 4. Counting
legend!!!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I'm out. I made it 21.5 minutes. It wasn't my nap time yet so I had to walk away.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
but good video by the way explains the basics, which is vital after all

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's some high quality chalk he's using there.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the comments. Here is what I thought. If both the objective f and the constraint function g are smooth, the constrained min/max must also occur at some critical points (if we extend its definition a little), as indicated by some directional 0 derivative. The question is how to define this directional derivative of f by incorporating the constraint g=c. If this could be done, then the second directional derivative could surely be used to test for min or max. 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Excellent lecture.  Dr. Strang goes a bit too fast.  But that is par for the course at MIT.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@ Rahul Duggal, the prof doesn't mean to change the column, he's just highlighting it to be obvious.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank you prof. Strang

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
great teacher

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
My neurons are enjoying...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
+Osman ÇALIŞIR All the lecture notes, exams with solutions and assignments are available on the MIT OpenCourseWare site at: http://ocw.mit.edu/18-01F06

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much for sharenig  knowledge with a rest of the world. Thank you...

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Wow! Thanks so much for uploading this! What an engaging professor.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Is there any other statistics course from MIT

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
It is a pure joy watching these lectures. Many thanks to Prof. Gilbert Strang and MIT OCW.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The Professor dusting the blackboard is so satisfying.

### 4. Counting
can we call him "Mr. strang" of probability?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is actually a doctor takiing math may be ???

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Can anyone explain 32:18 why u(t)= s e^(lambda* t)  s(inverse) * u(0) = e^A*t *u(0)?
From 9:33, for example u(0)= c1* 1*x1,  c2*1*x2 (t=0, so e^lambda 1 or 2 * t, are 0)

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
MIT may have cheap black board but not have high quality education.....any way its lecture from 2005 .......now there will be high quality equipments there

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you professor Strang

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Fantastic that you feel that way! However, when you get to college, you might encounter a professor teaching this that isn't anywhere near as good as this guy is .Don't let that discourage you, though! This guy alone got me through calculus. :)

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why the camera not following the writing at 36:30...

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For the determinant, we can also represent each vector as a column. It will give the same answer.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I get so happy when things like that look kinda hard in the beginning solves that easy just because you know how to do it :)

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
this guy is really good at the 3D drawings

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Professor Gilbert Strang is one of my favorite heroes 🦸‍♂️ 🙌🏽❤️✨

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Everybody praising Money Heist's Professor....Because they haven't seen Gilbert Strang.The Professor  👏👏👏

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
where is he giving this lecture? A train station? geez can't the students shut up?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
"shuffle" in practice or "random pick" in theory on 42:00

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks! Professor. Taking half month to enjoy this course. A total new sight of math!!! Inspire my attention for research,for study again!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This is real education.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he has a point

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
43:25 how did he do that...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I liken mathematics lecture examples to this: 

You start at A and work out how to get B.  But A and B could be anything.  Arbitrary values are put through the motions to vaguely solidify the concept during a "problem".  My issue with this method is its distance from practicality making a weak attempt to bridge the abstract.  It is generally impossible to measure and extrapolate predictions from these vague examples to help verify one's understanding of the underlying concepts.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm a physics eng. student from Turkey. Thanks a lot for videos!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
These videos finally make me realize that I wasn't stupid, my undergrad professor was!

### 20. Central Limit Theorem
Thank you Sir, Just wanted to say thank you, for giving me a deeper insight into probability. I studied this from the 1st lecture to this. I will study the last 5 lectures later on.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Can we say Wx + Xt ?   The x and t are subscripts. Or... does that imply a partial derivative only?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
"Any space with those vector in it must have all the combination of those vector in it. And if I stop there then I have got the smallest space and that is the space they span".  Got a feel. ☺️ Amazing Person.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Thank you MIT OCW and Professor Gilbert Strang.
After I had watched this lecture for the 1st time, I had to build up my understanding on Differential Equations and Taylor series, then I watched this Lecture one more time with carefully thinking through each step, and hence, I'm able to understand. Great lecture.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
But (with some help from Taylor expansion) he used that specific case to justify what he claimed about general case. So it's only irrelevant if you only need to know how to compute stuff and don't strive for deeper understanding of the subject.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
What's a pivot?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The end almost made me cry, we lived together something wonderful, Thanks MIT

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why didn't any students notice to the professor that he forgot to take the square of (2b/n)?

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture. i like this guy. Other teacher is good too, but this guy writes fast and explains things clearly for me.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why is it that a 1x3 row matrix has to be on the right of a 3x3 matrix for multiplication?(  I'm aware of the  mxn times nxp rule, just wanted to know the intuition )

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
😍🤤🤓🥳☺️🙏

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how can a senior professor of mit be so wrong he didn't put -a^3/3  with b^3/3  to find the area between a and b so this mit

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I loved this lecture and yeah I integrated cos^4x .. ...it felt like a live classroom it was not boring like other video lectures on YouTube it was lovely 👌👌👌

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Thanks Prof. Gilbert Strang for such a nice topic to discuss

### 16. Markov Chains I
just i can say great

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is all good but maybe breaking up the lecture into sections and many different videos instead of 50 minutes would work great. but he teaches very well

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Years ago I decided to study Linear Algebra. I done a Cert in Engineering and we hadn't done many matrices or enough. So I was really struggling. But I passed as I used the formulae (the course book I had was for Stage 2 and I should really have being Stage 1. But for all that time, out of curiosity I wanted to know what they actually were. I couldn't easily see then how they were vectors. The lecturer makes it clear. I could follow up to finding the eigenvalues. I had always been puzzled how they ignored the other numbers not on the diagonal. Trying an identity as he had and changing the numbers I realised what that diagonal - the trace he called it - was. Amazing! I realized that the 3  1 / 1  3  was 3 x  1 1 /  1 1   It doesn't change except in the amount, not the direction. But in effect only the diagonal from top left to bottom right are significant.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
"What's the long word for bowl?"

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The way he is teaching linear algebra by taking example of solving linear equations and not just throwing all the formulas without their incentive is really great.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
to share this quality of things is incredible

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]lol tryied to play it off? he immedietely listened to his students' opinion.

oh i am really sorry it was origin i didn't see and commented about a

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thanks for pointing this out.

Also, when vectors (1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 5) and (3, 3, 8) are written as column vectors and placed in a 3x3 matrix A, A’s first two rows equal (1, 2, 3).

Hence the rank of A is 2 and its nullity is 3 – 2 = 1 > 0.

Thus A’s columns are linearly dependent.


### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
TY

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this intro calc? Like if you've taken advanced algebra and trig, is this the best place to start? I have a textbook and a fair bit of free time at the moment. Is this video the right way to begin? Thanks :)

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In the last geometric proof to show angle QPR is equal to theta, he could have drawn a line from R perpendicular to the horizontal radius, instead of making the "rotation argument".

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
My friend I love your channel 😍 fully watching 💟👍💟💟💟💟💟💟

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
It's such a privilege to watch this honourable man delivering a lecture. Your lectures are helpful, especially, to the people living in a conflict zone like Kashmir, where the lockdown extends for months and this time it is almost a year with the continuous lockdown. Your 39 minutes lecture takes us more than 60 minutes to stream because of 10 months long high-speed internet restrictions enforced on us by the government's fascist approach. We have to make do with whatever we can with 2G networks. The board appears blurry because of slow networks.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, MIT. Thank you, America. ❤

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Sir, good night/day/afternoon. This video series look great, but I would like to know, what kind of mathematical background do I need to understand this course. Thanks.

### 34. Final Course Review
I just wanted to say Thank You Prof Strang.  Your videos were very informational, and I've learned a LOT.  I appreciate all of your hard work.

Thanks!

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Professor Strang thank you for breaking down and explaining Singular Value Decomposition in linear algebra.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I think he didn't explain an important  bit: why are the row picture and the column picture  equivalent? As in how do they both yield the b vector?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are all professors at MIT this good...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Professor Strang might be the best teacher I’ve ever seen

### 34. Final Course Review

### 15. Poisson Process II

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
It is amazing that MIT students can be smart enough to understand this, and yet be so STUPID as to believe the leftist, self-destructive insanity that the TV pounds into their little heads every day.  How about this for a Basian analysis: What is the probability that a student makes it into MIT (assuming through hard work rather than by having a fasionable skin color) and yet votes for Democrats?  My first Prior would be very low.  But based on the high rate of the decline of America as a civilized nation, I would bet that many iterations later we would find that this initial Prior was far off the mark. 😯

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this man is an amazing teacher.. i wish i had him!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Perfect, it s good to know convention and formal language to start.

He drives very well the 'meditation' on each step in a matematical way.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
I love this man. He is so concise

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get the block example, why is it 1 + 1/2 + 1/3? shouldn't it be 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 since the new center mass is the current centre mass plus half of the current mass before ( whichi is 1/2)?? can someone explain

I guess we could also take the 3rd vector by the cross product of the 2 earlier ones.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]18.02 is a required class for all MIT graduates, so the professor doesn't always go into the details of the analysis and whatnot. 18.024 is a more rigorous class for mathy people.

On the other hand, I do have to say that this class is actually more rigorous than the calculus courses I took in high school; certainly more so than AP Calc, which was mostly formula dumping.

### 15. Poisson Process II
The bus crowdedness experiment is great.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Thank you.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There are a lot of comments that some of the Prof.'s explanations are not rigorous enough. MIT has 2 or 3 levels of introductory calculus. This one is for freshmen with little or no high school calculus, and who will probably major in eng. where the key is to get the right answer rather than to be rigorously correct. If you go to the OCW website, you can find the one aimed at students who want to major in math or physics. It's totally different and much harder.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
baptistic: check out the transcripts of this lecture on the course page.. maybe you´ll find it less "sloopy"

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I see the space of no negotiations why don’t mind 🙏🏻? No consciousness of living togetherness in the wild . No truth no talking no incident on the wide😟.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Thank you Prof. Strang

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Oh no! Part 1 is missing! :(

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
In 25:50 , An alternative way to understand that matrix A doesn't have an Inverse is to visualize the matrix in a cartesian plane. 
The matrix is composed of two vectors: (1,2) & (3,6). Plotting these two vectors you will realize that they are parallel. Thus, they don't create a 2D area. They are a 1D line, one on top of the other. Reversing such vectors (applying the inverse matrix) would result in a  zero-D point, specifically (0,0). Thus, there is no inverse matrix for matrix A. 

Note: Finding that the determinant of the matrix A is equal to 0 would quickly depict this same process.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
hopefully this is 100 level because i knew all this in high school

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
These course works are amazing!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
nice trike bro

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
@[USERNAME], what was that sound ? some one with a flu ?

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Doesn't the number of flat pieces depend on how we fold the plane. Because if the second fold is parallel to the first fold then we get 3 flat pieces rather then 4 and the same argument holds for 3,4,... folds. 
So how we rely on that formula which gives incorrect answers when we change our fold keeping the no of folds same as it doesn't consider the spatial pattern we use to have a fold. 
Is I am right or I just missed something important?

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
Regarding the typo https://youtu.be/l4NoMKEHQwM?t=2785 (45:25), it's subtle. Namely, Var(X1+X2) = Var(X1) + Var(X2) + 2Cov(X1,X2) = Var(X1) + Cov(X1,X2) + Var(X2) + Cov(X2,X1). In case of Var(X1+X2+...+Xn) = Var(X1) + Var(X2) + ... + Var(Xn) + Cov(X1,X2) + ... Cov(X1,Xn) + ... + Cov(X2,X1) + ... + Cov(X2, Xn) + Cov(Xn,X1) + Cov(Xn,X2) + ... . Thus, the pairs of covariances are ordered, but if we selected non-repeated all possible pairs, then there would be this 2.

For finding basis for N(A), Why can't we use similar approach of finding basis for left nullspace. 
1) trans(A) - - - ->  RREF
2) E' × trans(A) = RREF
3) finding basis from E'

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There are people who can nail every complicated computational problems of single variable differentiation and integration, while at the same time have no clue about limits and continuities, and how continuity and differentiability differ in higher dimensions. Come back again when you fail mathematical analysis.

sir is explaning gud.. but slides are not visible properly.. can someone plz provide me it's soft copy?. it will be really helpful to me.. thank you.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
somehow i dont find the fact that the number of pivot columns is the same as the dimension of the column space obvious - the only way I could think of getting around this right is to get the row space involved.... would this do?

great lecture

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
42:12 , the answer is rank(A) = rank(B) right ?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I watched this video hoping to learn what the row space and left null space were good for and learned nothing new. This lecture recounts only the definitions of the four fundamental subspaces and their dimensions and works on an example of finding their respective bases. Like in his book "Introduction to Linear Algebra", Dr. Strang takes so many shortcuts and skips over the precise definition of many concepts and proofs and precise definitions of so many important theorems that I find his lectures (and book as well) useful only to a limited extent. I appreciate the effort but I believe there should be a better way of teaching linear algebra.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

0:15 "...Let's make this lecture immortal"

### 24. Classical Inference II
1) I think strictly speaking the likelihood function (at 15:45) which we need to maximize is the joint density function of the W vector, not the joint density function of the Y vector. The notation and the wording are kind of confused there. But the idea is clear. 2) The parabola/model around 28:45 is first called a quadratic model, then it's explained that it's still a linear model (at 29:50). I assume the term quadratic refers to the X, while the linearity refers to the thetas. 3) I think it should be noted that by introducing h(x) (at 29:57) we get more free parameters (apart from theta0 and theta1) e.g. if h(x) = a . x . x + b . x + c we get also a,b,c as free parameters. So the minimization now happens not just over theta0 and theta1 but also over a,b,c. And that's what might lead to overfitting (the presence of too many free parameters). Right? 

Great series of lectures though! Many thanks to MIT OCW and to prof.Tsitsiklis! One just needs to listen with care, and question (to some healthy extent) everything one hears.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In order to prove the existence of e, he should have proved "for some a, M(a) is non-zero" (or, M(2) is non-zero to take his choice of a) which he never did.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
If the integers are infinite in number, then most of them must be big, like really big, so, in the standard proof that square root of 2 is irrational, how can we be so easily sure that we can find and cancel any common factors from p/q to get the ratio into lowest terms?

The sound level is too low, maybe re-upload with increased volume?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
What if any Eigen value is repeated??? 
I guess that we still get 
n-orthogonal Eigen vectors. 
The reason:
We can relate it to the algebraic multiplicity and geometric multiplicity of an Eigen value. 🙂

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Prof Gilbert Strang is a teaching artist.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
We can have infinite possible set of Eigen vectors.
But in this problem,  we know from the definitions 
Sigma×u =  A v.
So we have to choose u according to the v chosen.
So in this case that u2 = [0, 1] is not corresponds to v2 chosen. 
The corresponding 
Sigma2 ×u2 =  A v2
==>  u2 = [0, -1].

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
Thanks for your presentation. Please in the case we use ordinal logit , should we report pearson correlation and omnibus test value? if it is the case, how to interpret them (for exemple, under or above p value, what it is the meaning). Also shoud we consider the sig level from the table 'Test of model effect' or 'Parameter Estimates' table to say that a relationship between the predictor and outcome variable is significant. I am really looking for ways to interpret, your answer will really help me. thanks.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
What is the difference between space and subspace?

The dimension of both row and column space of B =[0 1; 0 0] are same, right? So they are both in the R1 subspace. So the subspace of both row and column space is equal, am I right?  

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Even at old age he is razor sharp. I've seen old lecturers get confused; this man is extremely sharp. Great lecturing and teaching.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
My deam is to enroll in the Institute.

### Lecture 18: Weierstrass's Example of a Continuous and Nowhere Differentiable Function
'Differentiability is a miracle when it happens' -- Dr. Casey Rodriguez
' Assume f,g,h,... are all continuously differentiable' -- Me as an engineer

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Can anyone explain to me how he wrote the inverses at 21:42

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well when go in Bracket in Calculus make sure to stay consent don't come out that the mistake that can mess everything up in Hoptel

### 4. Counting
I struggled for the longest time with the discussion around 40:39 about "how many cases" there are. I believe what confused me was the instructor (who is excellent) started an approach with conditional probabilities, and then changed back to an approach with counting. ("If you're told that the first two are heads" sounds like a description of a conditional probability on HH in the first two spots, when we're really conditioned on "3 H total.") What I _think_ he means is that he's counting every instance in which HH are the first two options. The "the only uncertainty" phrase leads you , again, to think he's going to talk about probabilities. However, he seems to mean something more along the lines of "there are 8 cases where the first two of the three Hs are at the start, namely one case for placing the remaining H in each of the eight remaining positions in the list." Hope this helps someone!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
love this course

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
31:40  In the case of A = [2, 6; 6, 7] for example, when setting z = 0, what we actually get is a cross (an 'X' shape) ; when z euqals other values, then we get a hyperbola.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
At 14:00 that’s *not* true in general. The number of basis vectors of C(A) is rank(A) *yes* but said basis vectors are not the pivot columns. The professor probably misspoke or something.

Doing rref(A) of a matrix means we’re taking linear combinations of the rows of A, so there’s no reason to believe the column space will be preserved during the row-reduction operations. In general, C(A) is not equal to C(rref(A)).

Let A^T stand for transpose of matrix A. Then the following is always true: *C(A) = C( ( rref(A^T) )^T )* . He’s kind of implied this already in previous lectures without using the rote notation, I’m just connecting the dots like a game.

Edit:

A simple example is A = [1,2; 2,4]. rref(A) = [1,2; 0,0]. The column space of rref(A) is along the “y” axis whereas the column space of A is along the line “y” = 2 ”x”. It should be clear that aside from the zero vector, they have no other vectors in common. Further, rref(A) has one pivot column, so the dimension of A should be 1. 2*[1;2] = [2;4] (columns are linearly dependent, so we really only have *1* vector to scale. Hence, dimension of C(A) = r = 1, as earlier predicted 😊

Hopefully this helps someone. Professor Strang is one of the best educators out there, I see why people admire MIT! This playlist in linear algebra is the perfect way to prepare for the vectorized implementations of machine learning (if you actually wanna understand what you’re doing, that is). Best wishes to you all. 👨🏽‍🏫

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

The negative just shows the direction, in this case down.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
The invention and development of Google is due to Markov Matrices. The things that we see and use everyday in our lives is built on mathematical theory and concepts.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 19:56 the conclusion  about "the short curves are nearly straight" is such a non-rigid statement ... totally disappointing. In stead, the professor should use 1 < ( sin(x)/x ) < 1 to give mathematical proof the limit.  At 28:03, hahaha... how could MIT student not know the basics about arch length on unit circle equals to the angle in radiance? we all learned this in 7th grade when we were about 14 in Asia. At 31:20 the girl raised a good question, since the professor did not prove the limit of ( (1-cos x)/x) ratio in mathematical way, instead he used an intuitive way. I think, from 19:56 to 34:30 is a disaster that can be avoid in MIT class room.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Do not get too excited, he is not wearing a different shirt, he is wearing a coat, you can see the over-loved shirt under it.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
If you invert a tangential eigen value relative to the elliptical transfraction of its angular differential momentum are you going to end up with an algebraic postulate equal to the original eigen value or will it invert the transfraction into a post eigen mutation?

This has always bothered me.

The math, as I'm sure you'll agree, is not elegant - but is, at least, functional. 

Eigen (e)

e~n× t4.046 = a2 + a2r + a3 + a4 ÷ (integer extrapolate) ie 44 × Aa + aA2 (t4 f44)

Good lecturer, not sure I would want him as a professor. Explain man!

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Around 33:30, how do we know that x=xp+xn gives a complete solution of Bx=b? The way I think of it is that B*xp+B*xn=b+0, so we only get one particular solution that we chose arbitrarily. Can I make linear combinations with the null space basis vectors to obtain all the other solutions or what am I missing? Thanks

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Which book would be suitable with this lecture series??

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
In order to understand the A= QR part, my suggestion is to take advantage of the fact that Q^T is equal to the inverse of Q. So, multiply the both sides of the primary equation with the Q^t from the left. You will get Q^t A = R.

In this form, you will see more easily that why the elements of R matrix should be what they are and why R is an upper triangular matrix.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Did a crash course on Lin Algebra that purely calculated these. I knew all the steps. But did I really know it? Now i do.. Thank you Gilbert Strang. I endeavour to do ALL your courses that you have available on the internet. What a remarkable world we live in today..

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
49:46 It seemed for a second that the floor was falling Xv.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
pulling an all nighter studying linear algebra and I would have never done that if I hadn't stumbled across his lessons, hands down best teacher I had ever witnessed. I might fail in the exam but these lessons have helped me follow and understand much more than  ever.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
thank you teacher

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you for these lecture

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think you should rename the title as "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007 " not "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" << thank you mit for these great lectures

Best wish for you!
Good bless you!
God of 18.06!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
11:10  the guy in the first row is eating!! Omg, this doesn't happen in our country

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I don't care about Clinton or some others, the best thing for me is the distance between Dr. Gilbert and me is just 1.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For 13 minutes (21:00-34:30), Professor Jerison tries to justify (1-cos x)/x goes to zero, without, I think, making the case. While he convinces me that the "1-cosx gap" goes to zero faster than the arc length, he doesn't show that it goes to zero fast enough. For example, if it went to zero 10 times faster than the arc length, the limit would approach 1/10, not zero. 

I'm comfortable with his argument about (sinx)/x going to 1 and have in fact used that argument to defend the "small angle" approximation in Physics. (Larson 3rd edition, pg. 81 however, gives a rigorous explanation using limiting cases of  triangular areas bounding the section of the circular area swept out by the angle, and then applying the squeeze theorem, (1-cosx)/x is left as an exercise. 

But once you have the limit of (sinx)/x going to 1, just multiply top and bottom of (1-cosx)/x by (1+cos), the numerator becomes (sinx)^2  and the expression becomes: 
[(sinx)/x] [(sinx)/(1+cosx)], first factor goes to 1 and the second to zero. It's good to review properties of limits for this.

Where fault can be found, the good is often ignored. MIT and the professors involved are doing a GREAT public service by constructing these online courses. I'm amazed at the breadth and complexity of the courses offered. I deeply thank all of the MIT people involved in this. The examples and problems done in the class are excellent. I find many of the proofs easier to follow than in some texts. Thanks Professor Jerison!.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Well, this lecture is hard for me to understand, it confuses me. But I'm trying to see the big picture. Here's what I think:
The whole lecture is about how to use iteration methods to solve Ax=b, Ax=λx, Av=σu. Since for large matrix, it will cost a lot if we try to solve things like det(A-λI)=0 or do multiplication A*A.T,  we need to use iteration to solve it fast. And in the lecture, several iteration methods are mentioned: Arnoldi iteration, Lanczos iteration, and QR iteration. But I  do not understand many details in these algorithms, and I think I don't need it now, so I will leave these questions to the future.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
You rock Professor Strang!!!

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the last example could be solved easier when integrated over dtheta first

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
AMAZING Lecturer! Easy steps to follow and talks slow enough to understand. Thank you MIT!

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn't the small amount of heat required to raise the temperature of water be something like dQ= mcdT, where m=density*volume and c is the specific heat capacity of water?? Why does he just write energy = temp*volume?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

MIT Opencourseware,

In his explanation on the (1-cos (theta))/(theta) for the long piece (31:25) in answer to the lady's question, does the cos theta value as it goes out further becomes 1, so that (1-1)/theta yields 0 as the answer?

17:46 He states "mean is at distance 1/sqrt(n) from the expectation" but I guess it should be 1/sqrt(n) x sigma: 
edit: I guess it's the same question by SuperChrzascz

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Almost anyone in the comments are those who needed to learn linear algebra but couldn't because of all the horrible lectures out there and then they found this one. What a lovely wonderful course. I'm not even tired a bit. My first ever comment on a youtube video I guess so: Thanks a lot for the amazing lectures.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Thanks Gilbert...love your work. JS

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Why should we choose only between zero and one for the free variables? Can we not choose any set of variables for these? Is it impossible for these free variables to be any thing else? If I choose 0, and 0 as the free variables, I get [1, 1, -2. 1 ]T as the solution in the case under discussion, and that fits too. However, as suggested, that becomes a combination of these special solutions. Ok. Would it always happen to be this way, irrespective of which free variable I choose? For example, if free variables were to be 1 and 1, it does not fit a solution.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nothing special :) Thought MIT is much more difficult.

### 16. Markov Chains I
guys this guy is the best no cap.

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
It is mentioned that "phi is known positive value" (Lecture 23: 16.28 min). I am wondering,  if exponential dist. comes under canonical exponential family (or not), where theta = lambda, b(theta) = ln(theta) and phi = -1?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I just can't thank you enough for showing such a clear picture of these concepts. I was struggling to understand 3D Computer Vision and how the linear algebra involved in it. Your lecture series has connected all the points which I have tried very hard enough to understand but I couldn't until I followed your lecture series. You have shown the whole picture by explaining the logic behind each and everything. You are an awesome professor. Thank You so so much. The way you explain is incredible, brilliant.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is 3 am, I am hungry and I should have really taken care of washing today but I watched this 12 year old lecture on calculus instead. No regrets though.

Brilliant insights about teaching. Expected nothing less from the master, Mr Strang! He gives so fully to his students. It is privilege to watch his teach. Also great interviewer and a good pick of questions. Thank you for the video!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Definitely perfect final!!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
how can i find rank of a matrix ?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
lol funny I'm just first watching this today and it was posted exactly 7 years ago xD
thanks for the video, really helpful! I was struggling with this concept for my current linear algebra 2 course since I took the non-specialist version of linear algebra 1 which didn't really test us on proofs at all. I think I have a better understanding of the four fundamental subspaces now! :)

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Divergence theorem. From Your

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
4:12 This is something, I think, that's a little misleading. As far as I understand it (and I can be wrong of course), the eigenvectors are the same vectors. They just have different coordinates since by changing B to A, we switch coordinate systems/bases, but they still have the same direction and length, we are just looking at them from a different angle. Can somebody tell me if I'm wrong about this?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
but i am still confused as to where and when at all would we encounter such a situation where we would be required to find eigen values and vectors ?? any domain aor example in mathematics , any example , where we would encounter situations like AX=LAMBDAX  ?? Why at all we had to develop a whole subject of eigen , what was the trigger ??

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
a day after i watched this lecture. the proff in my uni proved induction too. and i can say that this guy ROCKS.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, Professor for your sincere intentions. This is the first course that I finished online and this content motivated me a lot to seek more. I believe you directed my path, Sir. Also, Thanks to the whole OCW family!

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
anyone mind explaining why, when we're trying to prove D  is not regular by contradiction, we can't take 010101 as a string, where the first 01 is x, the second 01 is y and the last 01 is z. We take the y and repeat it as much as needed and we still stay in the language.
why is that not possible? is it because 01 is same as 01010101....

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Amazing professor! Sometimes I just watch his 18.06SC from MIT for fun.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
In case 3 where m<n prof wrote min A+b. What does it mean? Is it stating the fact that pseudoinverse matrix does give minimum norm of vector A+b? Another version: it means that distance between A+b and b is minimal.

21:46
"Cheap MIT blackboard loool"

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This has got to be one of the hardest lectures to follow - even the students are baffled. "Where did that x^(-2n) come from?", "oh, well I just decided to perform 3 extra steps in my head without telling you what I was doing."
Smart fellow, but man, he's jumping all over the place without a lick of explanation.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I don't know why i am crying

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't like this guy as much as the other prof, seems to skip some necessary explanation

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Can anyone explain to me why the answer for cost of B is $n^2$ around 40:00?

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I believe at 2:58 he said the angular velocity in radians per second not gradients per second.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I wonder if the couple at 15:03 in the second row is still together.

### 16. Markov Chains I
very good lecture

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
28:55  Seems Accurate hahaha

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Really clear lecture. Awesome job.


### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
At my school(FIU) Linear Algebra is taught at the junior level. Its mostly proofs and is incredibly painful. These videos help, but I'm still fighting just to get a B.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Agree!

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
perfect freshman course; amazing

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i study at ETH and we are 0% allowed to do these geometric proofs so i was kind of shocked to see them

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
amazing lecture. Thank you Professor Strang, Thank You MIT!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
They still use chalk boards?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This vedio saved my life,I can't stand the counter-intuition way of learning anymore,human'thinking ability should be used in exploring way

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Leaving the proof as a cliffhanger, almost worse than Fermat…

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Incorporating MATLAB commands in the lecture  is a great way for students to learn about  matrices and linear algebra in context. The overall lecture  is another classic by DR. Gilbert Strang.

### 17. Markov Chains II
39:58 I don't follow this logic. Why do the number of upward transitions need to match the number of downward transitions? Won't it depend on the values of p_i and q_(i+1)?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I remember I would watch this series of lectures while I was taking both Calculus I and II at my university. I dominated those classes, and I think I owe a big thanks to MIT OCW because I believe these lectures made a significant contribution to my understanding of Calculus. For me, these lectures have become as important and memorable as the real classes I've taken at my university. Thank You! 

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the proof at 15:00 is the best geometric proof for sin(theta)/theta -> 1 as theta ->0 that i have seen....the bow thing will help me never forget....thanx

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I didn't watch the first one. I just checked this out real quick to see if I understood any of it.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
these lectures are awesome, but as someone who didn't know anything about linear algebra, i DEFINITELY suggest watching these  videos by 3blue1brown instead or first, depending on amount of time avaliable: 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

One actually understands what "matrix multiplication is a composition of linear transformations" means and why that is really all one needs to know in order to truly understand matrix properties and operations (instead of just memorizing them).

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you very much Prof. Gilbert

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good Job Professor

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
how do we know..?, when we do A*Inverse(A) gives an Identity Matrix before finding  inverse(A)?

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Has the book he said he was writing completed ?

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
I find it really helpful to pause and try to proof the theorems before they are worked out in lecture.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
24:21 unless you are using a brainfuck matrix calculator or some dark forbidden program of the type.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great Job Professor

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
haha soooo true

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you 😊

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
question:
a bit before 10:45 when the student asked the question the prof replied that the same procedure will be followed to calculate the magnitude of the vectors.
But vectors are supposed to have a direction too, so how can you extend the dimensions to more than three (or is it possible?).
Time can be one but that will make things a hell lot complex.

### 34. Final Course Review
이건... 전설이다. I'm so happy to finish this course although I didn't do any homework stuffs except exams. Prof. Strang will remain as the best professor about linear algebra forever in my heart. Thank you so much. And I specially thank for uploading these series on the web and opening to everybody in the world.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
44:40 - No, it's not making the mean zero that creates the need to use N-1 in the denominator.  That's done because you are estimating population mean via sample mean, and because of that you will underestimate the population variance.  It turns out that N-1 instead of N is an exact correction, but it's not hard to see that you need to do *something* to push your estimate up a bit.

Surface area heat change occurs so it is d/dx2

### 16. Markov Chains I
excellent

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
at 25:17 when he says (row1)^T * x=0. This is wrong. Row1 is 1xn and x is nx1. Row1*x=0. row1^T is nx1 and you can't multiply a nx1 vector by x another nx1 vector.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I am not able to find the Functions of Two Variables Mathlets. MIT OpenCourseWare KINDLY HELP. Thanks!!

Outstanding

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I've studied in university for 10 years and I haven't come across a better math lecturer. Best math teacher I've ever come across. He actually teaches but most lecturers just repeat stuff without connecting with students.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
This  spans all my Spaces. Thanks to @lexfridman for pointing me in this direction again 30+ years after first taking and passing the course but not understanding anything.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
We can say that we were the first ones watching his great course! :)

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
What are the chances that the joint pmf is 4/20 ?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This is brilliant! I can see why MIT is one of the best universities in the world!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

I don't understand the thing about the convergence rate :S ..You take the difference and then what..?

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
very interesting thanks

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Excellent as always and thx MIT.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
If the rank is only one, it can't get away from us.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
How can i just remember every bit of these lectures always? This is education in its true sense, sometimes i feel watching video is a better form of education than personal interaction, if you understand wat i mean

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"He was born earlier.. it was natural idea.. and died earlier too" xD

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
We're "executing" a determinant of formula here, ahhh I f-ing love professor, wish that I could attend his class huhu.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I love you Gilbert

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
super liked! worth watching last half to understand vector space clearly than reading hundreds of books.... 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
helps me understand what my teacher is actually talking about, thanks :)


### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
@[USERNAME]I agree, it's almost magical :-). Or as he puts it: elegant.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I'm taking this course (Linear Algebra) at the nacional university of Rosario, Argentina and this lectures were really helpful. We use Strang's book so this is perfect.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
p(a and b) = p(a)*p(b|a).


The probability that both a and b occur, when only one event can occur is:
given that a occurs the probability that BOTH a and b occurs is the probability of a occuring multiplied by the probability that b has also occured given that a has occured.


On the other hand, if it given that B has occured, then the probability that both a and b have occured is the probability that b occured multiplied by the probability and a has also occured given that b has occured.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
43:00 Climax

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
The lecture is amazing

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Hi.  Is U the b in Ax = b?

### 3. Independence
Answer of king question is 1/2. There is no "GB" option. it is not permutation. if you care about ordering, then you must choose another "BB" and "GG". "GG" is not important actually, but because of another "BB", the answer will be 1/2.

### 4. Counting
Hello, where does 8 come from?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish this guy was my Calc 2 instructor...  I guess in a way he kind is...

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Because he explained it well.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
can anyone explain these statements at 11:41 , rows of c are combination of rows of B. as we are multiplying a row of matrix A  by a matrix B to get the row of matrix C. It just i didn't get these statement what it is referring to?.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In what year is this subject taught?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
46:30, 46:45, 49:45

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I hope that beyond the year 2050 somebody finds a way to upscale this masterpiece of lecture series to 1000K 3D holograms.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
31=(34+28)/2

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Can anybody help me to see how is a vector time his transpose a projection? Thank you very much in advance :) 

Btw, amazing courses, you're truly lighting the way, Mr. Strang!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Best wishes to you!
祝您健康长寿:)

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi is a great scientist 
His name gave rise to the terms algorism and algorithm .

### 13. Regression
wow how can this lecture be underestimated? watch his lecture from the beginning not just this part

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is x_0y_0 = 1  ?
middle schooler here, please don't mock...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]watch Nat Geo's My Brilliant Brain. There are 3 origins of genius

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
So nodes are like some 0 dimensional thing; 
edges are 1 dimensional since they connect nodes;
loops are 2 dimensional since they have area.

I never understood that weird Eular's formula, finally linear algebra shed some lights on it ~

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks, Prof. Strang! Rarely are teachers clear, quick and informative combined. Loved watching this course :3
Bravo!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
800th upvote. Very good video!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Listening to your voice has been my priority these days.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
How did we arrive at Xpivot=-Fxfree

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
35:24 the moment of truth

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you think that you have much to learn. If you don't have much money, but you're capable, you get most of your tuition paid for.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this dude must get paid soooo muchhh

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I guess I don't understand how the last vector set creates a subspace / plane.  Since x, y, and z are utilized in both vectors, wouldn't the subspace essentially be all of R3 with linear combinations being able to extend through that plane infinitely due to z?

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
36:15 why if we add semi definite matrix then the eigenvectors will be greater? Why it so obvious? Of course it's true for the largest eigen value, because we can use some maximum  property of first eigen value. Greatest eigen value equals matrix L2 norm - and the norm of matrix is the maximum of norm Ax, i.e. xAx ,so when we add uut we get much more ,is x(A+uut)x >xAx. But why it is true for second and other eigen values?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Not so illustrated. A lot of notions are not clearly defined

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
guys, for the triangle doubt, people are confusing this with fx,y = 1/lx.
its not that, it's the distribution of y and x.
which means 0 <= y <= x <= l.
suppose if both y and x were to only go till l, then it would look like a square with length l. But now since y cannot be greater then x, we remove that upper half of triangle where y was greater than x and hence our triangle comes in the picture. It tells us the possible values of y when x goes from 0 to L. If we want a joint pdf of x and y, it just only depends on x. Here joint pdf = 1/lx . where we just put the value of given x.
Now, we have fx = 1/l and fx,y = 1/lx. We need to find the marginal pdf of y, which is the integration which results to log(l/y) / l  .
Now we have all three of them and can find whatever we want like  expectation and all.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Pretentious. MIT you can do better!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
this lecture really puts together the concepts of pivot ranks, null space and special solutions, and complete solutions to Ax=b. I think we've also covered row reduction to get the augmented identity matrix to find an inverse and transpose.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
now i´m starting to learn something new, this teacher never insinuates that the questions that are posed are stupid or unapropried, this teacher is a good teacher.....

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Damn, I wish I had Gilbert Strang as a professor... oh wait... I wasn't smart enough to get into MIT's engineering program....lol

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the best lecturer I have ever witnessed! Everything is so smooth

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
AWESOME

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
STRANG GANG 2020

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
like it

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]note that the geometric proof is conditioned for theta = curve length in radians. that's why limit of sin(θ)/θ tends to 1 as θ --> 0, for the ratio between the vertical length of the cord (sin θ) and the curve lenght (θ radian) = 1. However for  (1 - cos θ) / θ, where the horizontal distance from origin to the cord is cos θ. The ratio between the gap (radius - cosθ) and curve length (in θ) ---> 0, for the gap is much shorter than the the curve length, and thus goes to zero faster

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
39:12 NERDGASM

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hi, did he say integral of 0 to infinity dx/(x^p) converges when p>1 or is it the other way around?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
wow ! That's Beautiful !!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
43:02 "Fridi" 
God I love this man.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

Great Professor!

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I prefer to first divide the integration according to the path, then choose the appropriate coordinate system for each path. Thank you.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what the hell did I just write.. I was just thinking out loud. with my fingers. and now I did it again. that's it I'm going to sleep

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
6:12 "Negative infinite" should be undefined. Right?

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The students are really stupid. The professor is trying to teach how to setup the limit of the integrals but all the students want to do is to compute it. They keep on suggesting ways to "simplify" the computation missing the point that it is not in the least interest of the professor to actually carry out the integration.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Does anybody tell me the material link?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Well, I'm getting puzzled here.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

Prerequisite for this course and absolute must for amateurs like me https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

### 14. Poisson Process I
Even Professor Tsitsiklis might stuck in the middle of the proof of Poisson distribution PMF...but the proof is perfectly written in his textbook, which is the BEST by far I've ever read in intro level probability and statistics. It took me a long time to fully understand Poisson process...thanks to MIT OCW and Professor Tsitsiklis.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

I completed the course today. And like everyone, I feel like a different person than who I was 34 lectures before. For me whose weakness is being consistent, I enjoyed the course till the last minute. Thank you Prof Strang for giving me some valuable insights not only about Linear Algebra, but other topics as well (Graph Theory, Complex Numbers, Statistics, and so on). Thank you Prof Strang, and MIT OCW for sharing this treasure with the whole world! 
I can't say I will be missing you because I am all ready to see you in 18.065 :) God bless you Sir!

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
Who knows for sure with deminsions. You do good to dream the Riemann.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
He is the best!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
thank you so much for sharing this course, I'm living in a country where buying things from other countries like online courses isn't possible due to sanctions. these free courses are the only things that let me learn, thank you again for your awesome website and courses.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]just a few will understand it... You got the point.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
bro helped me beat Zodiark. thanks man

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
I am here to leave a like to the legend.

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
This just so good to be true, fantastic!!!

One of the Best lecture for understanding Conditional Probability and Bayes theorem.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
From 1,012,547 views in the first lecture to 203,355 views in 27th...You belong to 20% who made it this far, Congrats!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This same material is covered in my grade 12 vectors and linear algebra course

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I Really Like The Video Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume From Your

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Can this procedure be expanded to deal with problems in multiple dimensions? So a, b, c, and d are not scalars but actually vectors themselves, representing the inputs x1, x2, x3 to a function f(x1, x2, x3). How would you form R that way, and would you have different condition numbers for each element of b?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
The complexity of linear algebra has been reduced by him too.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in the script i think it should have meant "secant"? 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at the start, with x^n, shouldnt it say n in R, not n = 1, 2, 3...? or does the binomial theorem only work for integers? I think it might, right--but then how are calculations like (x^e)' = ex^(e-1) justified? is there an alternate proof not using the binom. theorem, or is there an extension of it to R...?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Wow, I love this guy :D

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
30:30 i guess this should be at the beginning of the lecture
but it was a very nice lecture thank you for ur efforts <3

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Which book does this class use?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Quite possibly the hardest lecture, so far.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You don't know what you are talking about.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is not on the divergence theorem..

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Isn't the proof a little sketchy if we have to differentiate more than once? I thought by definition the lim x-->a (f(x)-f(a))/(x-a) is f'(a)... So f'(a) is forced to exist. Otherwise aren't we arguing that lim x-->a (f(x)-f(a))/(x-a) = f'(a) = lim x-->a f'(x) which needs basically another proof? (Min 19-20) 

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Amazing! I like linear algebra a lot, I already had this class in college, I keep reading about it and ... I didn't even notice the passing of 40 minutes of the first class you! No wonder MIT is a world reference!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Low D-High Minus High D-Low, all over Low Squared we go!!

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
I take the risk of looking stupid. The professor said at 32:10 that density is probability of little intervals. But didn't he defined in the earlier lecture that density is probability of unit intervals? Am I getting anything wrong here?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Fuck math!!! I hope all math burns in hell, its useless and to confusing and complicated I hate it so much!!!!!!!!!

### 34. Final Course Review
I survived!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I love how every lecture so far they managed to come up with a new and creative way to record sound. It's cute buy annoying.

i will make donation when i become succesful

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
magic!

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
Couldn't we have used the chain rule?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
He is much older now, but still incredibly sharp, up-to-date, and deeply on the money 😉, I might add.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 15. Poisson Process II
For those confused like me regarding the fishing example:
for part d): The number of fish caught can be found in 2 ways
Consider 3 Random Variables:
F: No. of fish caught
T: Time (The values that time can take)
FishTime: FishingTime (The values that fishing time takes, note that this is different from Time r.v.)

1) E[F] = E[F|0<T<2] * P(0<T<2) + E[F|T>2] * P(T>2)
                (0.6*2)       * 1               + 1              * P(0,2)
 

2) E[F] = E[F|FishTime=2] * P(FishTime = 2) + E[F|FishTime>2] * P(FishTime>2)
                E       * (1-P(0,2))               + 1              * P(0,2)
Here E will not be = lambda * tau
This is because if he fishes for exactly 2 hours it means he will definitely not catch 0 fish.
So we need to calculate the conditional pmf. That is P(catches k fish|catches atleast 1 fish)
Then use this to find the new Expected value by multiplying with k and summing for k = 1, 2....
Then put this for E and calculate.

Gives the same answer.

Would they please stop calling Nesterov's algorithm ``descent''? It's not a descent method as Nesterov himself keeps repeating. Otherwise, a wonderful lecture, and an impressive feat for the lecturer given his age.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
What a legend!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
you are not a clear teacher because you not clear any step

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I don't think I've seen a proof for (AB)^T = B^T A^T that he uses in proving A^T A = (A^T A)^T at 40:30 yet in this lecture series, so you'll need to google around. I recommend youtube ID# Uri_d6o5KNs

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the asshole filming this ruined the video...

it makes it really hard to watch when it zooms in zooms out zooms in zooms out. all they had to do was set the frame back far enough and not fucking touch anything.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MIT!!!!! great help for reviews

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture reminds me of a question I've always had. It seems like the operations of lim is not really rigorously defined and proved. For example, in the last example it is assumed that lim(a * b) = lim(a) * lim(b). But if we consider lim operation as a function then this is the same as assuming f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b), which doesn't seem so obvious to me...

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Question
23:40 - so you have H2 and to build H4 you did H2(H2)
To get H8 you did H2(H4) but do H4(H2) = H8 as well?
Because I was thinking if you put H4(H4) you would end up with 16 terms and that should be the same as making H4(H2(H2)) since, well, H2(H2) = H4...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
calculus is hard

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this what they learn in college in America? ... I learned this last year.. I'm 16 right now. 

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
@[USERNAME]I get that, but that doesn't answer my question. What I mean, is that around minute 14:00 he says that the error is vertical instead of orthogonal to the line. I thought we were trying to minimize the error by orthogonal projection. I'm probably mixing things up, but I don't see it.

I'm no expert but around 15:30 
The prof. depicts the parallelogram in the UV plane ,but in reality the the sides are still on the axes in the UV plane because the axes them selves are sheared. But when we look at it from the vantage point of the XY plane ,they take the form such parallelogram.

nah i honestley finished at 31:31. i hope im wroong but if you start with y in a expo in the first quadrant then you are looking for trouble. there is no y obviously. but i will look on and be proven that he is searching and will find me short falling

### 3. Independence
Thank you Sir.
I was curious to know where you are from.Does anybody know?

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The names aren't fancy, they're explanatory. Single variable calculus is just what the name says it is, calculus involving only one variable. I'm sure you can figure out the other one. Calc 1 or calc 2 don't tell you what the subject is actually about.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You just said something exactly as he stated it.  I know exactly what he did.  My whole point is that the logic of solving each limit independently is flawed.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the bit about 80 - 5t^2 is incorrect
the number 5 is not exactly right.
The gravitational acceleration is actually equal to 9.81 meters per second per second.
(or depending where on earth you are it might be 9,80 but never 10)

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
This is just beautiful.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
At 7:24 he changed Ax=0 to ux=0, why?
Previously in lecture 4, he taught EA = u. Confused here, please enlighten.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
students who think changing the extension of word doc from .doc to .pdf = pdf conversion 😂.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I did not understand the last step replacing dA by dxdy. The proof contained slanted plane with an angle alpha to only one axis and not a general slant in both directions. Does this proof apply when we are considering a general slant to both x and y ? Will dA=dS Cos theta still be applicable?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
cosin of the angle = dot product of vectors divided by the product of the lengths

dot prouct is a1b1+ a2b2 + a3b3
product of lengths is sqrt(a1^2 + a2^3 + a3^3) times sqrt(b1^2 + b2^3 + b3^3)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the education is, it's almost the same everywhere, but you can not overrate the students and the teacher, something you will understand if you look at achievement comparison between universities

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Actually it is. Watt is energy/time, Watt hour is W.h (not W/h or Watts per hour), so it is equal to energy/time x time, which is equal to energy. For eg. a 100W light bulb which is ON for 1 hour uses 100W.H of energy.

And yes, metric rules!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, professor Srang
Thank you MIT

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
change the order of integration.  upon doing this you should get limits on outer integral: lower=0, upper=3; limits on inner integral: lower=0, upper=y/3 where the integral is e^(y^2)dxdy.  now you get xe^(y^2) and evaluate that from 0 to y/3 to get y/3e^(y^2)dy.  Now use substitution u=y^2
du=2ydy du/2=ydy which gives 1/6e^u for the integrand, limits being 0 and 9, and when evaluated gives 1/6(e^9-1)

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
lol "what function has that derivative!  okay.  it's a freshman course" 

love this guy

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
17:44 

What he called "geometric interpretation" was actually the definition of a dot product and what he called definition actually follows from it. 

Am I correct? Correct me if I am wrong.

Edit: In short I want to know which definition is the fundamental definition.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
The real problem for Physicists is Truth in Labelling. Putting individual's possessive names over the top of self-defining informational identification instead of behind it in the Bibliography,  ..no one knows what the reality of Actuality is.

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
Note: Videos of Lectures 28 and 29 are not available because those were in-class lab sessions that were not recorded.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shockingly bad pedagogy on so many levels.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This stuff is awesome !!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT really has the best professors 😃

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That is bs proofs of the sinx/x geometrical proofs aren't that good. What you should do is the use maclaurins theorem and make sin(x) into a polynomial function. Which in zero acctually equals sinx. Then it's real easy to see that sinx/x is equal to 1

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
Why does he say his definition is ambiguous? In what ways does defining a function as some subset of AxB make the definition less ambiguous?

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
BIG DEAL if you do it in high school, in the 6th grade or in grad school, freshman year, etc, BIG DEAL-A hundred years from now, you will all be DEAD as a rotting corpse. So who cares if you learned it sooner or later. A hundred years from now, you will be NOTHING!!!!

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is it common in physics to use angle bracket to denote vectors instead of standard matrix form?  how to differentiate a row vector from a column vector, or it doesn't matter, we just  assume the dot product is the product of two or multiple vectors with the same length yet orthogonal orientation?

### Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure

Finally I watched the whole. Thanks MIT for all of its great lectures!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
What courses would be beneficial for applied economics and econometrics students? Thanks in advance!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love blackboards, i dont know why i had to study in those white-shiny-boards :S

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Everything so simply explained.  thank you

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Someone save me back I didn't use stop loss I didn't see it coming

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love how the first lecture had 2+ million views and every other lecture after decreased just like in real life

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Not only is he going faster than what the syllabus calls for, but he managed to do that without loosing me. Dr. Strang is very good at what he does.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
I was kinda hoping that Prof. Strang started this lecture with his comment on "Does DL usually work?" from last lecture... Was that part edited out?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
It is good lecture. But, about the example you used about kissing does not fit many, especially non west cultures. In some cultures and religions such things are not acceptable.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy's chill i like him

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Proff i will hug you whenever i will meet you..

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He lost me at the inverse functions.  Is the purpose that it gives us a way to rewrite the function to make implicit differentiation easier?

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
At 28:00 what is the intuition behind shape of the bowl and large/small eigenvalues? He made it sound like a quite obvious statement. 

Also at 36:50, given that S and Q-1SQ are similar implies they have same eigen values. However, how do you show S and Q-1SQ are similar? 
OK I figured out the 36:50 part. It is the spectral theorem which sir had covered in previous class. S = Q (lambda) Q-1. 
Lambda = Q-1 S Q. As, lambda is defined as the matrix of eigen values of S, this implies that S and Q-1 S Q are similar. 

Please explain the part at 28:00 . Thanks!

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yes!! its adamn shame because many of the other ocw lectures have excellent camera work. this guy is maybe the best professor ive seen, but the zoom-tastic camera work makes following along much more difficult!

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do you think he purposefully stopped erasing boards while they were coming down simultaneously so that the students wouldn't cheer? Because throughout the lecture series it seemed to progressively happen less and less which makes me sad.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am not in MIT, lol. I'm a second year biochem student in the UK teaching myself maths for fun. I am trying to watch all the lectures for this, and understand them. The problems you can find online however are a bit beyond me!

Enjoyment. Professors are great.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Not really.

### 16. Markov Chains I
Why is he using recursion but not a transition matrix, is it because recursion is a more general notation?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
24:56 how did he figure out what the numerator had to be at 25:17? I am sure this is some simple algebra, but it's been a while :)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you for this video

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lecture, but his "proof" of the dot product interpretation from the cosine rule was a bit of a circular argument, ie. dot product if and only if cosine rule. I would say a better approach would be to DEFINE dot product as A.B = |A||B| cos (theta) and then DERIVE A.B = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 from this, which can be done algebraically without reference to the cosine rule. Otherwise, good stuff; he seems a good teacher.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This professor is an artist and I can't understand why some people disliked this video. Thank you from Brazil :)

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games

Thanks MIT

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Professor Strang is a god among mere mortals.

### 21. Hierarchy Theorems
For Check-in 21.2, how comes D rejects <D>1000000 on Step 1?

On input w, mark off f(n) tape cells where n = |<D>1000000|. Then what happens?

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
This 12th lecture is really confusing me.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
maybe MIT students are too smart to focus on the algebra detail on matrices operations, but that was some fk up algebra work.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
The lecture on Complex  Matrices and Fast Fourier Transform are excellent. DR. Strang also explained these two subjects in  Computational Science and Engineering I and  II at MIT.

He's creating a ratio of a complete circle. Kind of like saying 90/360 = 1/4. Another way to get his equation is to integrate the equation for arc length:

Arc = rθ

Can anyone here care to explain how in the example in one dimension, when choosing a scalar outside R it grants that the stochastic gradient and the full gradient has the same sign? (corresponding to 30:30 - 31:00 ish in the video) Thanks in advance!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I'm afraid this video doesn't seem to provide any proof of the significant theorem on the blackboard which insists:
=========================
  N((A*)A)=N(A), i.e., the nullspace of (A*)A is identical to that of A, 
where A* denotes the transpose matrix of A. 
(For convenience, let * substitute for the conventional superscript T meaning "transpose".)
  ========================
I'd prove it my way, at least for all real number matrices A and real number input vectors, like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof.   Let A be a m-by-n real number matrix.  And then, for any input vector x in R^n
  Ax=0　⇒  ((A*)A)x = (A*)(Ax) =0,
so that if x is in the nullspace of A, then it is also in the nullspace of (A*)A, that is,
  N((A*)A)⊇N(A) ...(1).

On the other hand, let
  a[1], ..., a[n]
 be the column vectors of A.   In other words, let
  a*[1], ..., a*[n] 
be the row vectors of A*.   And then, for any input vector x in R^n, for each of i=1, ..., n, the i-th component of the product vector
  ((A*)A)x=(A*)(Ax)
is the dot product a*[i](Ax).   Therefore, ((A*)A)x=0 implies that for each of i=1, ..., n
  a*[i](Ax)=0,
so that Ax is perpendicular to any linear combination of the column vectors a[1], ..., a[n], i.e., to every vector in the column space C(A) of A.   However, as a linear combination of column vectors
  a[1], ..., a[n],
Ax is also in the column space C(A), which combined with the previous statement means that Ax is in C(A) and at the same time orthogonal to C(A).  This is possible if and only if Ax=0, because otherwise Ax is not perpendicular to itself (see note at the bottom for another reason).   

Thus, after all it has been found that, for any input vector x in R^n
  ((A*)A)x=0 ⇒ Ax=0, 
so that if x is in the nullspace of (A*)A, then it is also in the nullspace of A, that is,
  N((A*)A)⊆N(A) ...(2).

(1) and (2) combined, implication is that N((A*)A)=N(A).　QED.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Note):  If C(A) = {0}, then trivially Ax in C(A) is the zero vector.   Otherwise, by the so-called Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, an orthonormal basis can be chosen for the column space C(A) such that all the basis vectors are normalized and mutually orthogonal.  Then, the vector Ax in C(A) may be expressed as a linear combination of those basis vectors, namely
  Ax = s[1]n[1]+ ... + s[r]n[r],
where
  n[1], ..., n[r]
are the orthonormal basis vectors, 
  s[1], ..., s[r]
are real numbers, and
  r=rank(A). 
However, since being orthogonal to C(A), Ax is perpendicular to each of the basis vectors.  Thus, for each of k=1, ..., r
  0 = n*[k](Ax)
    = n*[k](s[1]n[1] + ... + s[r]n[r])
    = s[1](n*[k]n[1]) + ... + s[k](n*[k]n[k]) + ... + s[r](n*[k]n[r])
    = s[k], 
implying that Ax = 0.  QED.

Thanks.   Was I correct?   Are there any simpler proofs?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
What you call "old school" teaching, when teachers actually cared about their students and worked hard at the black board, instead of just ripping through a bunch of slides at warp speed. It is sad that students these days have to pay such ridiculous sums of money for that nonsense when you can get a gem of a man like this here.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you have interesting idea. But your x never goes to zero. If we take y=sin(x) and (y/x)=1, well we'll get a graph of y=x which is a diagonal line of 45 degree; not x-->0.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
The eigenvector u_2 related problem in Example 1 is about the scaling factor. 

Dr. Strang said that all the scaling factors should be larger than 0.
But if you set u_2 as [0;1], like in this lecture, sign decision issue arises.

Av_2 = [ 4 4 ; -3 3 ] [ 1/sqrt(2) ; -1/sqrt(2)]  = [ 0 ; - sqrt(18) ] = - sqrt(18) [ 0 ; 1 ]
Incorrect -> sigma can't be negative sign

if we change sigma_2 to have positive sign,
Av_2 = [ 4 4 ; -3 3 ] [ 1/sqrt(2) ; -1/sqrt(2)]  = [ 0 ; - sqrt(18) ] = sqrt(18) [ 0 ; -1 ]
Correct! and obviously, u_2 we've got is [ 0 ; -1 ]

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
I've been taking proper notes, doing the readings, and all the things you would expect of a student (short of taking the quizzes and final). I'm surprised at myself for having the will, interest, and sustained performance to get here. I'm tooting my own horn because I think I deserve it. Thanks to Professor Strang, I haven't just learned one of the most beautiful frameworks in mathematics. I have also proven that I can focus and get things done. If you knew me, you'd know that I'm unreliable, highly motivated at first, but that I ultimately lose steam and perform poorly. This class taught me that when I choose to do something to completion, and mean it, good things can happen. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Professor G. Strang! Seriously, I'll always hold you in high regard. You gave me the MIT experience. You made me really wanna roll up my sleeves and learn deeply, learn how to think, which is impressive because I'm a college dropout who wanted nothing to do with education (well, schooling, you come across that line of reasoning, I'm sure). This course has improved my confidence. I just wanted to let you know, the special touch you placed on every lecture was precisely what I needed to start to see education in a whole new light. I've said it a million times now, but thank you Professor Strang! And of course, many, many thank you's to the MIT OpenCourseWare for making such high-quality, timeless content available to millions like myself for free. You're changing minds.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
HOW AM I MEANT TO LEARN THE MATERIAL WHEN THE CAMERA HARDLY SHOWS THE BOARD??!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The proof for (uv)' should be simpler: 
(u+Δu)(v+Δv) - uv = uv + uΔv + vΔu + ΔuΔv - uv = uΔv + vΔu + ΔuΔv. 
Dividing by Δx and taking the limit as x→0, we instantly obtain:
uv' + vu' + u' x 0 = uv' + vu'. It's more logical that way, and we can clearly see why the formula looks the way it does.

We can of course make the process lengthier by writing instead of Δu and Δv their full expressions: 
u(x+Δx) - u(x) for Δu and  v(x+Δx) - v(x) for Δv. By doing so we get:
(u+Δu)((v+Δv) - uv = [ u(x) + (u(x+Δx) - u(x)) ] [ v(x) + (v(x+Δx) - v(x)) ] - u(x) v(x). And the proof will take more space, while it is still gonna be exactly the same as the two-line proof I have written above. In fact I believe students should practice both writing the short proof and the longer version just to clarify things for themselves. 

Now then, by knowing the end formula (uv' + vu'), we of course can prove it as in this video by trying some adding and subtracting tricks to make the end formula uv' + vu'. That's mathematically correct but it conceals from you why the formula looks the way it does.  *That said, the lectures are otherwise superb and deserve kudos in my opinion and a huge like.*

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Hey MIT, thank you so much for posting this! If you want to improve the sound, try using an expander (a compressor set to a less-than-one ratio). To make the chalk more visible, the contrast could maybe be turned up. Come to think of it, the expander is just like audio contrast! After expanding, you may want to apply a maximizing limiter. The Waves L2 plug-in works great ($30), and you can do all this audio work in Ableton Live ($250 for students).

My mentor at work told me a few months ago I need to learn analysis. Since then, I went through 18.01, 02, 03, and 06 to refresh, and to see this lecture series up now is just perfect--thank you again!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's not hard once you wrap your head around it. The only thing that gets me is when the prof is on a roll and explains things really fast, but that's why he takes question breaks so that students can ask for a re-explanation.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Bro, this professor is good, but he needs to speak up @MITOpenCourseWare

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One easy way to actually derive the whole inverse matrix formula step-by-step is by creating an (n)×(2n) size matrix, then put arbitrary coefficients on the left side (columns 1-3), and then the identitiy matrix on the right side (columns 4-6), then row-reduce the whole thing until the left side has become the identity matrix.
If you do that then the right side should become the inverse matrix of whatever was on the left side in the beginning, and from there you can also factor out the determinant from all those coefficients.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I've done this whole course, none of it has been very hard. Except his third method of matrix multiplication. I'm totally stumped and its the only one he doesn't explain clearly. I can't find anything on matrix multiplication row by row. Does anyone have any other key words for this - maybe a big name like "hyperporaboloid" or "quaternion tensors" or something?

In the union between the plane P and the line L, explained from 05:00. There are some cases in which the union can be a subspace. This case occurs if the L is a subspace of P, meaning if L lies in P and goes through the null vector (0,0,0).

I am convinced that MIT 18.065 is  one of the best math courses in the world.  There is no exaggeration to say that it serves as the mathematical enlightenment to me    thanks Dr Strang

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
I didn't know about Markov matrices, they are very interesting.  So all n x n matrices with each entry equal to 1/n are Markov matrices, with eigenvalues 0 and 1 (1 because they are Markov matrices, 0 because their rank is equal to 1).

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Have a small doubt,
Can anyone please resolve this.
As sir said that if we take 2 columns in matrix then sir got a plane as a subspace ..It means if we take the linear combinations of 2 columns then we get a 2-d plane which passes through the origin right?
And now I tried with 2*2 matrix taking 2-d vectors and I should get a line which passes through origin if we take linear combinations of those ..
But I again got a plane ?
Am I doing wrong in making the subspace of  R^2?

thanks

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@[USERNAME] Not sure if you someone told you or if you already saw the next video, he did point this out. Not be mean, just wanted to let you know.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
*12:23* he has a point, of all letters you choose u and v😂😂

### 34. Final Course Review
It's a little more into matrix theory than that. He's assuming that we've already done the elimination process, and if there were any repeated equation while eliminating, it would yield an entire row of just 0's -that is, no pivot. So in essence saying that there's no pivot in one of the columns is the same as saying that one of the equations was repeated. The rank, r, is the number of pivots, m the number of rows. So if r<m, there must be a column without pivots, and the solution is not unique.

Thank you.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I often watch MIT
It was amazing😘

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
This is another fantastic lecture by the ring master of MIT mathematics DR. Gilbert Strang. GRAM-Schmidt  is a classic topic in linear algebra. An individual student cannot have too much linear algebra.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
These lectures are very helpful for those who need to understand the material in depth.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
One question Prof. and guys, how comes sigma in the middle is diagonal (square)? shouldn't its dimension (m, n) ? Thanks!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When's he going to get on to multivariable calculus? 

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I love it. I get to go MIT for free learning.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 31:18. The professor says that Fxy ALWAYS = Fyx. But  Fxy doesn't ALWAYS = Fyx  according to Khan Academy. Isn't Khan Academy right ?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Due to the pandemic, I have to take LA at a local community college online. And taking a course online meaning you are on your own, learning by only reading notes and textbook. Before Prof. Strang's lectures, I was struggling with the class. Now I understand the subject much better. Thank you, professor!

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
It's a great video because I can review what I learned this year

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I was totally astonished by the idea of computing left nullspace!
Thank you Dr. Gilbert.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
30:48 it's all about the feel!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
This class was pure art

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:37 to 4:42 Yeah, turn that off. It's distracting me.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think he presented gaussian elimination very clearly. It's important algorithm for example in the process of inverting matrices

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
طيب مافي مترجم!؟.
ي جمآعه آبي موقع ولا روابط تفهم لماده التفاضل والتكامل ٢ ضروري

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thanks very much for those videos. For the first time in my life I finally understand those concepts. Hopefully, statistics textbooks will become less scary from now on.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is all of this course multi variable differential calculus? I am taking multivariable differential calculus next month and don’t want to learn multivariable integral calculus yet

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lol, go through all of the videos to understand it, you can do it with Khan Academy to go through things you don't understand. Not as hard as it looks, just try to smooth out all the things you're confused by, step by step, and eventually it will make sense.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
34:09

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
O MIT OCW, please release videos onto YouTube of the 18.100B, 18.100C, 18.700, 18.701, 18.702, and 18.901 courses!!! And, also of the complex analysis courses taught at the MIT! Please do seriously consider this request.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Yuxuan Wang
Congratulations on reaching here. Cheers!! :P

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Good visualisation of what he's trying to explain at the start: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
This is just amazing how clearly he explains the topics, big thanks to the professor.  I wonder which other courses he teaches at MIT that are available in OCW? Also I think the Prof. is an author of the stats book for this course which must be great as well so need to look into getting it!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Then find me the derivative of (45X^5)+144X+15+(1000X^3)-(4X^2)

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Is that video available or not? I'm following the course on you tube but I can't visualize this particular lecture (n° 27).

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Dr. Rodriguez, in minute 53:58 you mentioned that the limit as n approaches infinity, how do we know that the series converges?  Thank you Professor, this has been the best Analysis class I've ever taken, I finally understand this.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Does anyone else have a pet peeve with the mathematical notation used for numerical value generated by the random variable as g(x) at 41:00? The professor says at 9:10 that "x" (in lower case) refers to the numerical value generated by the random variable. Why does he use g(x) for it later? Loosely speaking, he could have referred to it as g(sample space) as well, and although it isn't strictly a function of the sample space, it at least honours the the initial conception of "x" as the value generated by the random variable (which can be thought of as a function of the sequence(s) of events that satisfy the constraint g(sample space)=x).

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Its funny how much better this class seems compared to my college.....

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
LOL - those annoying computer-generated comments are all over the MIT videos I've been viewing. Any theories why they exist?

### 14. Poisson Process I
Although it is true intuitively that the T2, T3,.... all will be independent exponential random variable but the pdf for K=2,3,4 is not exponential...How can you argue about that??? anyone?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
You complete me.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
😍😍😍😍😍

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
At 17:35,  Shouldn't either of cos(x) or sin(x) should be the basis because either of sin or cos can be generated from the other. (like cos(x) = sin(π/2 - x)

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Nice topic and wonderful lecture! 👍 I like it!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Which math course is better to do after this?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
A quick observation for 39:45. We can also prove that det(2A)=2^n det(A) by noticing that 2A=2IA=DA, where D is a diagonal matrix with twos down the main diagonal. Then, det(2A)=(by 9)=det(D)det(A)=(by 7)=2^n det(A).

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
@[USERNAME]it's like an identity matrix except the 1s don't go across the diagonal.  The 1s are moved here and there to denote row operations

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He should provide a proof showing why dropping the terms is correct using product rule.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This class is Beautiful.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
nice

Even tho this is a good college but we wont like it

### 34. Final Course Review
Great!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Ha ha :-) "Gauss thought of it before we did, but only because he was born earlier"

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He's thinking "I'm trying to teach these kids 3-dimensional calculus and yet they can't figure out which hand is their right hand..."

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
is this course applicable for lab analysis of data using statistical methods ? im a physics student wondering if this is worth the time to learn

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Curve sketching actually begins about 30:00 in.  Before that is a review/extension of linear and quadratic approximation techniques.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
17:10  "you can see from the way I am speaking what the answer is going to be..." 
--wish my profs spoke like him...


### 25. Classical Inference III
Thanks to Dr.Tsitsiklis for this course.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Great Lecture!! Helped me a lot.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
There is a problem with Dr. Strang's lectures.
The problem is, he makes it so intuitive that I'm literally nodding in agreement the entire lecture. I've now watched the lectures once, read the book chapters, and watched the lectures a second time. And while I have a good grasp of everything discussed so far, they all sort of blend in. I couldn't list the things I learnt one by one for these 10 lectures. :D (well, I sort of can.)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I don’t know why he left the forth column out from the elimination process and rather came back to it later.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The way you clean the blackboard is infuriating to me. I can practically smell the dust from here.

But great lecture.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
When he asks a question how many people pause the video and try ?

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this teacher is very very good.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much MIT and Professor Auroux!!! You guys really make the entire course so easy, so organized and so interesting.

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
Great lecture, this has help me a lot to understand the book

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
brilliant! 

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Tell Pr Strang he is an absolute legend and many people over the world have been immensely helped by his work. My God bless his soul!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
at 27:00, how come you are just able to factor out the diagonals? If you take out d1, arent all the diagonals in the matrix from the 2nd row to the nth row,  dn/d1?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

note to self -a

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
In 2007-2008 I was lost, starting a PhD, completely lacking of a solid math background. So I watched his linear algebra course videos. A few years later I followed the one of Stephen Boyd on Linear Dynamical Systems (and recently part of the one in Convex optimization). These resources have been fundamental in me becoming a well-earning professional that still enjoys learning. Now, when I interview young people for Junior Data Science positions, almost all of them put the cart before the horse, just interested in the trying the latest method, even though they really don't understand what it does. I try to recommend them to follow the same path (start from the basics, follow good-old video lectures) but most of the times this advice is received as an eccentricity: "Linear Algebra is soooo far away from the cool stuff, man". So, my guess is that a course like that will make my point easier. Looking forward to discover it :)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I hold a very radical theory which I do not expect everyone to accept.   "There is no such thing as a negative number".  Elements are defined by the number of protons in their atoms from 1 up.   Temperature goes from zero Kelvins up. A person cannot have a negative age,  a duck cannot have a negative number of ducklings.   The square root of a minus number cannot be obtained.    If there are 14 apples in a box, you cannot take 15 out of it.  Food for thought.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Bless you, Dr. Strang. Your lectures should be part of an Arctic Vault/Time Capsule so that aliens can drink from the fountain of your knowledge.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
He sounds like Senator Pat Geary from Godfather 2.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Brilliant lessons !

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Thanks Prof Strang, MIT!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
can you please tell me why we took lagrange multiplier in the pyramid?(at the end of lecture)..why gradiend of both func have to be parallel?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Transpose(a)*(b-xa) is a dot product because well you can clearly see Transpose(a) is a vector but what about this expression (b-xa)?! well (b-xa) is a vector because we know that (b) is the vector we also know (a) is vector and (x) is a scalar hence 
vector-scalar*vector=vector

### 17. Markov Chains II
Intro => Most of the lecture, we're going to concentrate on their steady-state behavior.
meaning, we're going to look at what does a Markov chain do, if it has run for a long time.
What can we say about the probabilities of the different states? 
So what I would like to repeat is a statement I made last time that Markov Chain is very very useful class of models.Pretty much anything in the real world can be approximately modeled by a Markov chain provided that you set your states in the proper way.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]caught not catched


### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Let Aij be the cofactor of aij in A. Then by definition detA= ai1Ai1+...+ainAin. What would happen if the Aij were taken from another row?
let B be the matrix with the same rows as A except for the k-th row that is the same as the i-th row. Then, bk1Bk1+...+bknBkn=detB=0 cause B has two same rows. But bkj are aij and Bkj are Aij (cause Aij =(-1)^(i+j)Dij and Dij eliminates the column and the row so it'll be the same)

Consider C= A*(adj(A))^t. The position cii will be ai1Ai1+...+ainAin= detA. cij with i!=j will be 0 because of the lemma proved above. Therefore C=detA*In, and with some algebraic changes, A^-1=( adj(A)^t)/detA

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 2:12 i started laughing, because I remembered a line from "the big bang theory", from the first episode

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Ok I figured this out. Let B=CD.  if C is invertible then CDx=0 is equal to Dx=C^(-1)0 therefore Dx=0 is equal to CDx=0. that is why N(B)=N(D).

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
"soo...cramer found a rule" sounded like we're talking about the one from seinfeld stumbling upon some deeper mathematical truth

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
I'd never thought I would binge watch anything apart from movies and seasons but this course got me wrong. All Hail Prof Strang!!!

### Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
39:09 I AM

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
hahahah I don't see one blonde in the class. 

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Wow! Euler characteristics just came out of nowhere.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
I love prof. Strang and I'm very grateful for his lectures, but I have to admit I don't find this proof convincing. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the project he starts out with (@3:32) is to prove that every matrix A has this decomposition. But @13:26, he starts out by **assuming** that A has this decomposition, and then he deduces what U, Σ, and Vᵀ must be. But that doesn't show that every matrix A has this decomposition. Instead, it shows that *if A has this decomposition*, then *that's what U, Σ, and Vᵀ must be*. Even if we were to argue that we can obtain such U, Σ, and Vᵀ for any matrix A, prof. Strang doesn't show that by multiplying UΣVᵀ we will get back A for any A. 

I struggled with this topic for months until I finally could arrange everything into what I believe is a proof for why every matrix A can be decomposed this way.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
sexy ass lecture! he made it so clear

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
33:07 dude, there's something moving under the professor's desk.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sinceramente pensé que el MIT era una chingonería, la gran verga erecta de la enseñanza científica y tecnológica de EU. Ya ví que no es así (al menos no en lo que respecta a matemáticas). Este maestro es un inepto; Casi podríamos decir  que es lo análogo al IPN en México, casi, porque desde luego la infraestrutura es infinitamente mejor  en MIT y en general ellos siempre van a enseñar un poco más y mejor; No hay tanta corrupción ahí. Pero es análogo en el sentido que siendo EU deja mucho que desear, es pues, mediocre igual que el IPN, en México. Pero esta mediocridad en el IPN, no es sino reflejo de precisamente la complexión intelectual y moral y expresión del retraso que en ciencia y tecnológía( y no se diga en la enseñanza en estos temas) tiene un pueblo como México y que éste ha colocado al IPN como "pilar y baluarte" de la enseñanza científica y tecnológica en el país y como "palanca de desarrollo", cuando, al menos, no es tal.

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b

Ad hominems make your argument weaker. You seem to think the past did not affect their present. The past affects their present. As a group, they are disadvantaged. It was group policy from the gov't to treat them like cattle. Now the gov't believes otherwise. Fortunately, your point of view is not held by gov't. Identity groups may not be important to you but it is to gov't. That's why there are social programs in place since the Great Depression. Believe what you want. Many like me feel they

50:30 Anybody knows if it matters that the right angled triangle is in a different quadrant?
Thanks man!

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
I followed every lecture, thanks Prof Strang, the course changed my view of Linear Algebra

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Beautiful lecture. Thank you very much.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
NB

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This instructor is wonderful.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
THANK YOU SIR!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did he ever defined what a limit is ? where ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like turtles

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
i love this man... i found a best teacher

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great professor as always at MIT.  However, I wonder if there is a mistake here for the deduction that he did (time: 13:28/46.03Min)...I did not get it.

Delta (U/V)=(U+DeltaU)/(V+DeltaV)-U/V

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU 
Better watch this video to visualize matrix multiplication.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone have the exam materials and the solution?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wish I went to MIT.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
I don't even understand the title of the video

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah... question!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Text book recommendations anyone ?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Prof. Gilbert Strang's videos had helped me during my M.Eng. study, I watched him once again in 2011-2014 during my PhD. Last year I got his new book, and today I am watching (again) he is teaching linear algebra for data analysis, signal processing and machine learning because I have to teach Fundamentals of AI for my undergrad students. Thank you so much Prof. Strang, you are my best online mentor in mathematics!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
How is the nullspace of the 2nd matrix (-1,1)?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Great class! Thank you!  I have a question towards the end when we see that E(A) = I or Ainverse(A) = I.  Does this also mean that Ainverse = I/A ?

### 13. Regression
Such a great lecture! the best intermediate-level gold. Thanks.
Please dont fall for the parts where he forgot. He always tries to convey things that might not be obvious just from passive-reading.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
충성충성

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Amazing!  Thanks MIT and Professor.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I love the way this guy says "way" and "when"

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really like the use of zoom!!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Good mathematics teachers are a gift from the gods.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
this is the least satisfying of the Strang lectures I've seen.  everything is so dumbed down until he gets into factoring the Fourier matrix and then all of the sudden doesn't really show that the factorization is correct.  Not even a rudimentary hand-waving.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
22:00 he says cubed that's "(x-1)^3"

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Explanation of the relationship between the determinant of the Jacobian and the change of variables was handwavy at best! Would be nice to see a rigorous derivation of how these things work instead of accepting a magic formula...

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I have a question here, for me a point in 3d is zero dimensional, but if some living entity is smaller than that point some microscopic living thing, for it the point will have some dimension, so, is it so that the vector spaces that i am studying, I can visualise in my existing space, if someone is there in some different space they will do some other vector space?The solution will remain same  in different spaces for a particular problem or example??

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Unless you think of probability as belief in bayesian statistics, the whole framework makes no sense.
Statistics aids human epistemology, it's not a replacement for it, even a UMP test result can be rejected as a definite method of learning on other relevant grounds.

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
Sherman–Morrison formula 👌

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do College Profs use such Large chalk???

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the teaching style in india is much better

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
খুবই সুন্দর লাগলো...

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in determining the range of of the area, the function depends on x....

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He wears the same thing in every video that I've watched...

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
What a great professor

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Excellent presentation...Start watching 10 minutes in
...Bayesian starts 18 minute in

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
A Sipser MIT course. :-) :-) :-)

Quit the Row Picture, already.  😅

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I've watched and really enjoyed the previous lectures, but I have some doubts regarding this lecture.... what I have learnt from the book by J. Coley is totally opposite (interchanged) to what professor explained about Contour plot and Level curves......  Hoping for anyone's kind reply. Thank you.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The Bob Ross of maths :)

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
26:42
Sir is explaining and he is not even caring!
Bad Attitude!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks a lot "super" Gilbert Strang.  All I know about linear algebra I know from your lectures!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did it go?

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'm the 107.064 viewer

### Lecture 21: The Riemann Integral of a Continuous Function
I am confused with Thm2, the instructor said and explained like x is coarser than x' but since x' is contained in x and considering the definition of the partition, isn't his explain should be opposite while he is proving Thm2? so x contains x' and more I think

### 18. Properties of Determinants
One important thing determinant says about a matrix is how much the volume/area/length is changing. Everything become much clearer with determinants when you learn this fact. There exist very good videos on Youtube about it, where you can see it in action.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MATGRRIXUE!!

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
These lectures make me so regret that I was not fortunate enough to go to MIT and sit in this legend's classes.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can please someone explain me 5:06? Don't get it :/

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
I couldn't write the link, so I will send you by e-mail.

### 17. Markov Chains II
Thanks for iploading


### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
we love you very much Gilbert Strang :)

### 34. Final Course Review
nice course and teaching.
 hopefully can take next steps from here

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Newton's method is so good that it takes only 26 steps to get x^2 - 5 root starting at 2 million

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow this man is a bomb👏🏽
Jesus is the Son of God. Believe in his death and resurrection then confess his lordship over your life. Love yall🙏♥️

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is brilliant, go MIT!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
28:50 -- The real answer to the question is that the negative there swaps the order of the vector columns. -a2 (b1c3-b3c1) = +a2 (b3c1-b1c3).

This is necessary because the way that the terms in the 3x3 matrix determinant are calculated actually requires you to horizontally scroll the matrix.

|a1 a2 a3|
|b1 b2 b3|  -> a1 (b2c3-b3c2)
|c1 c2 c3|

|a2 a3 a1|
|b2 b3 b1|  -> a2 (b3c1-b1c3)
|c2 c3 c1|

|a3 a1 a2|
|b3 b1 b2|  -> a2 (b1c2-b2c1)
|c3 c1 c2|

The reason why you have to horizontally scroll the matrix has to do with the noncommutativity of transformations. i.e. if you to rotate 90 degrees to the right and then rotate 90 degrees up; you'll be facing a completely different direction than if you rotated 90 degrees up and then 90 degrees to the right. Transformations have to be done in a very specific order: xyzxyz;  xy = -yx, zx = -xz, yz = -zy

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
19:28 ... that was a lazy proof of why sin(theta) -> theta ...  when theta -> zero ... lazy lazy ...

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing, this man gots his doctorate degree at 22 years when most of the people gets their undergrad. "astonishing"

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Excellent professor

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
If anybody fails with this guy as a teacher.. you should automatically be kicked out of school

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
At 38:30, Strang says that det(Q)^2 = 1 means that det(Q) is 1 or -1...but that's not true if det(Q) is allowed to be complex. Twenty lectures into this course and I have to mentally question everything so far to see what does and doesn't apply to the complex numbers.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
Would love to see more from Alex Townsend. What a fantastic lecturer!

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
This professor is the platonic version of a professor

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lol at algebraic questions

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
“Let’s talk about failure!” Excellent and nice!!!

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
For Wavelet, the transpose of w4 is shown in the video, or we can say we need to transpose w4(as shown in video) to get a orthogonal matrix

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
First 4 minutes are a very poor introduction.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand hahahaha

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you very much

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Are the samples really independent? The 2 59s, they probably impacted.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can you guys please attach the PDF of the exam and it's solutions in the description. It would be great. ☺

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
cool

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
30:38 YES!

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished a very important evaluation on Multivariable calculus...wow! I dedicate my fine grade to Denis Auroux...don't know how he does it...but his methods are really impactful!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
It will be such honor to sit there to listen Mr Strang’s lectures

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
2020 corona lockdown 2 months finished the course June 2nd, 2020

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what ages are the students in the class?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I'm Fayçal from Casablanca in Morocco and I do thank you so much for this courses, it makes me see matrices clearly :)

### 3. Independence
I think there is one more assumption, that 'GB' and 'BG' are considered sequentially on the two children context. Otherwise, it should be 50% that the sibling is a girl.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]Thank you man! That was a very good explanation :)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME], I get this and I learned it all as a freshman in highschool and as a sophmore now I understand this,

### 25. Classical Inference III
When he said "this is called a statistic" it felt like that moment when they say the name of a movie in the movie.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It was nice when everyone was happy with dot products

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Yes. I actually am the dog and the kids too. All of them.
So. If I haven't seen you I supposed that it has to be because of matrice's elimination. 

*C'est clair*

*BIEN*

### 16. Markov Chains I
I was so suprised when the rij(101) = rij(100). Beautiful.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is video of 18.014 available？I hope to learn it after completing 18.01

### 34. Final Course Review
Watching this whole course has been a really impressive experience. Informative, clear, and relevant. I am still amazed by the clarity of Prof. Strang with subjects that run the risk of becoming extremely confusing or abstract if delivered in a more "standard" manner. Truly grateful to MIT OCW for making these high-quality contents available for everyone!

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
just a small note 15:43) A_t*A is positive "semi"-definite, in general. If A is non-singular(if all columns are independent), _then_ A_t*A is positive definite.
26:02) It can be solved by 'calculating' like u2 = 1/sigma2*A*v2, but the essence is that [the sigmas don't have to be positive, it's just that WE CHOOSE them to be positive].
[u2 / sigma2 / v2] - ANY one of them can have different sign. It's just our choice, like -p=q*r and p=-q*r and p=q*-r are all equivalent.
(of course the order of the columns and sigmas are our choice as well - that's how the sigmas are ordered like that)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Hey, did the guy make some mistakes, when he did the pivot numbers? I don't think the third pivot number should be 5, it should be -5 right?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Simply brilliant

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I think you're best in Linear Algebra Course and actually you live when you are teaching courses:d

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm mexican and I learned Differantial Calculus when I was 17. I took me a semester to complete the course and then I studied Integral Calculus. Both courses were in English.


### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
Professor looks like sting.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
omg jezz this is sooo basic to do at university we do this in high school in ireland!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Nothing beats the good old blackboard as a teaching tool... especially for math

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
good

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
In 18.05, the camera movement was very nice. In 18.065, I think the camera person is not that professional.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
me: everything is clear and easy 
*start using miles and feets*
me: lost

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
24:31 the guy's tee on the bottom right. A good MIT student.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To think the prof has to teach them how to calculate a determinant.  Smh.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
rank=dimension of c(A)=2. how can c(A) be 2-dimensional. rectify me if i'm wrong. is it not a plane inside 3 dimension?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wonder how they got into mit

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Matrices of linear transformations, isn't this part supposed to be in first courses ?

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
44:00 covariance matrix

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, MIT OCW, for great work you!  Thank you, guys, who leaves funny and helpful comments, from MIPT (Russia). It really helps to  improve and refresh knowledge. Our MIPT's course is built more on how to prove theorems. Maybe it's useful, but sometimes it happens that  students' skills to prove theorems and solve exercises are like two different areas without crossing.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is MIT still using chalkboards ?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
2021-10-11

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Damn at the end when he said have a nice weekend I believed it for a second  but then realised it’s Monday today

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
very very good & clear thanks very much MIT

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The fact that anyone anywhere can learn this is revolutionary, I think
Some impoverished Einstein now has a golden opportunity

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
my question is, despite being the most prestigious technical university in the country, all they can afford is old school Black Boards!!!

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
great

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Who can say why When the professor mentions Symmetric Matrices, the top left and bottom right digits don't equal? Is it necessary or irrelevant? 
And is it possible to explain what the represent linearly? 

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT & Professor Miller! This lecture helped me a lot with AP Calculus. I don't know what I would do without this lecture and the other lectures that you guys upload. :D 

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When I was in U the best fit line was calculated by noticing that if you add the deviations you might get even zeros if others are positive and others negative. So you can't just add naked deviations. So our teacher showed that if you take the absolute values and try that the derivation of the line is horrible mess. So next best way to get out of negative deviations is to square them and that was easy calculation. So, that was very illuminating excercise.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:06 Why did he subtract 2 units?

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
excellent Job Professor

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]But you know on the other hand in my first Mathematics semester at college we also first went through all the stuff we learned at school. However, like you wrote, it's the MIT and I would expect some knowledge about such basic things in advantage.

### 3. Independence
Sir looks like Creed from The Office. 
All in all great lectures

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
But is still good that you say that now so we don´t get too confused. Thank you.

And Thank you Gilbert Strang for this work!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
讲得好！

### 25. Classical Inference III
Finish in a week!. moving on to Topology, and optimization + graph theory ( not sure yet). LETS GO! I AM GOING TO IVY LEAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but the gradual shift into abstract concepts is done flawlessly by Professor Strang. In the first few lectures, really up until the lectures on bases, all of the methods Professor Strang uses to teach the subjects were concrete examples; very little was done with abstract definitions and arbitrary matrices. Over the last few lectures, Prof. Strang has made a gradual shift into abstractness which let's the mode of this sort of thinking sink in. Now, in this lecture, nothing is concrete and no numbers are ever used (until the end) and it feels effortless to understand! This man is a genius when it comes to math education. Thanks so much MIT and Prof. Strang for the amazing experience!

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
just checking if Alex is still alive?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
18:23 "I'm ready for the kill", amazing!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good Prof but brain wash message

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
even the beauty gilbert strang cannot make me love that freaking algebra

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Woah, it's so cool to see him teaching here 😮

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
What if we consider only rational numbers inside the square? In this case, the set is countable but individual probabilities are still zeroes.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
🙏🙏🙏🙏

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gilbert Strang and Dennis Auroux are the best teachers I have learnt from and I haven't even attended their class physically, ever ! Thank's a ton MIT for developing a liking for mathematics in me.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you so much!  Enjoy your teaching!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dear sir,
isn't the linear approximation formula the first two terms of the Taylor Expansion? Is Linear approximation like Taylor Series but for linear functions?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Those chalk knocks like nails in the casket.
Or house.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
He's a famous mathematician. Feeling privileged after watching his lectures.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Ehhh, I get that these lectures are great for a lot of people and this man has a passion for math whose teaching has helped a lot of people, but I don't find these lectures are the best for learning the material as I was lead on to be. I find this lecture more theory based without too many examples showing you the step by step methods that others, most notably Professor Leonard, have done. That's understandable given format of the classes at MIT I guess but it would have been nice for me. Maybe that will change in his later lectures so I'll stay in for now.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Is the equation in 22:00 written with matrices M and M inverse switched?

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Is the distance matrix right?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
sir you are a living legend! Cannot thank you enough.

hello


### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
why does nice have more likes than Awesome?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A MATH STUDENT IN INDIA PREPARING OF IITJEE WOULD KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN ALL THESE IN HIGH SCHOOL ONLY

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Se vale lavar el pizarrón.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In Italy we don't have such beautiful chalks and erasers!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
great

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why use binomial theorem instead of Taylor expansion?

And professor said it is single variable calculus, but there may have many variables like x0,y0 to confuse peoples. But I think there is only one variable x, x0 is just one value of x.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
very useful !!!!!!!!


### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
2 by 2? Easy 
3 by 3? WTF?
3 by 3 Column? WTF
HELP

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
This lecture singularly helped me through the concepts on use of eigen values for capturing variability

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
P(B/A) would be Sensitivity in Epidemiology. P(Bc/Ac) would be Specificity. This is a great lecture.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Se

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Glad to see the classroom with students:)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Be assured it works just the same way if you have 10,000 variables"

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor Dennis Auroux's #1 Fan

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This is really great and brilliant lecturer i never seen before. I like the methodology he is using and he knows how to engage his students.
I can see now how linear algebra is applied.
Thanks Gilbert Strang and MIT.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Just based on the lectures until now:
we can’t just put a = between rank(A) and dimension of C(A) right? 
The number 2 may just „happens“ to be the same. 
We calculate the rank by finding the numbers of pivots with row elimination, which changes the column vectors and the eliminated column vectors are apparently not the linear combination of the original ones.
Maybe I will figure it out in lecture 10.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Witches'.

### 16. Markov Chains I
Python code for the Markov chain n-step transition example: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/YoungxHelsinki/jupyter-notebook-cheatsheet/blob/master/Markov%20chain%20n-step%20transition%20example.ipynb#

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
i think his a french as " r" is not well pronounced

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
block multiplication again.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished whole single variable calculus, both prof. David Jerison and prof. Haynes Miller are amazing teachers, 
Thanks MIT OCW for making this possible. India, 2020

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is nice to see someone who cleans the blackboard fully!!!

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This is an outstanding lecture on Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are very important for solving linear systems especially in differential equations. MIT and DR. Strang thank you so much.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yet ur watching....

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
Slight slip at 53:02. The ratio is always greater than or equal to zero.
So set c to zero rather than minus infinity to always conclude H1.
At 1:01:40, on the other hand, we now have the difference of two logs
which isn't necessarily non-negative - it can range from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome teacher...

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Why doesn't MIT use wet sponges to clean boards with?  >:(

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
6:15 COMO FUNCIONA EL CEREBRO HUMANO ....

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]If you use iPhone, then open a browser and go to wolframalpha and search for Limit[(1 + 1/n)^n, x -> Infinity] or just lim_(x->infinity) (1+1/n)^n.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
How many blackboards do you want?
Dr Strang: Yes

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
This guy is so cute

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I feel so emotional at the end of the lecture!!! Long-live Prof. Auroux and MIT

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Amazing lecture professor, but I think someone ripped ass at 18:00. Can experts on the subject please verify for my sanity?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Glad to see he's well!
Much better than the 240p quality of the original linear algebra videos.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
not sure why MIT is so revered, this is almost verbatim what i had in my linalg class. i suppose the research is where its a bit different.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
It's not that she found a numerical error, it was the power of her reasoning for it. I'm shook, whoever that girl is, she's clearly brilliant.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
This lecture just brought my understanding of norms to a whole new level! Thank you so much Professor Strang!

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
Which unıversıty

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Нихера не понял, но лайк поставил)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]Did he just dis Gauss? Boy there's no telling what was natural in Gauss's mind

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's actually not review. Its part of the material for calc 3.

### 15. Poisson Process II
Those paradoxes and the addressal of them: so good!

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Thank you so much, sir. From India.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
will this be on the exam?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]i also forgot to mention that you can also type in the name of the college eg. harvard, cambridge, StanfordUniversity, UCBerkeley, nptelhrd, calcommunitycontent  etc. (these are some that i have discovered with online courses being offered) in the search box and their channels or lectures would come up. from there you can check out what courses each individual schools are offering.

### 3. Independence
There seems to be a mistake in the explanation for why pairwise independence does not imply independence ...  at [36:30], event C should be that 'our tosses gave different results', rather than 'our tosses gave same results'.
After checking the book, and my suspicion is confirmed. See example 1.22 on page 39.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
00:00 det(I) = 1
03:16 det(P) = 1 or -1
07:00 The determinant is linear in **each** row.  
11:34 2 equal rows => determinant = 0.  
14:34 det(A) = det(U).  
19:00 Row of 0s, determinant = 0.  
22:20 det(U) = product of pivots
28:30 det(A) = 0 <=> A is singular
37:40 det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)  
41:40 det(A^T) = det(A)
47:00 Odd / Even number of row exchanges

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I did this in my last year of high school !

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Excellet lecture. Many thanks professor Strang!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you, karsonson. It makes sense to me now.

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
FCP

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]He would, however, expect his physics teacher to teach him vectors which are used to represent Force, Displacement etc in physics. Dot Product is also highly useful in determining force distribution. More useful in engineering , perhaps, than physics, but there you have it.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Given that column space and null space of a transpose are perpendicular to each other, if p is a projection of b on A then shouldn't it be parallel to N(At)? How can it be perpendicular to N(At) as well? any help pls

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"@35:53 Forget the word 'associative', but don't forget the law". Love this.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
You should include the case where the saddle point runs diagonally to the axes. Then you would have two critical points, neither being max or min.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
If you guys find the determinant of the matrix, it shows Det = 1*(16-15) - 2*(8-6) + 3*(5-4) = 0. So the matrix is not linearly independent.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
I think the shape of the bowl will change when we add (x^T)b at 17:00 . Am I right???

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks to Professor Strang and whole MIT team for providing one of the best content free of cost. I have completed the journey today.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
This vedio has thousands of fundamentals in those 50 minutes!!!!! Amazing Proff.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
The meat starts at 09:56 for those who don't want to waste their time.
21:50 I'm not sure if this is correct :p The probability of 0 assigned to each of these points would mean that there is _absolutely no chance_ I hit _any_ of them :P So I wouldn't be allowed to hit anywhere inside that square, and I'm also not allowed to hit outside of it, so I simply am not allowed to throw the dart at all :P What would be correct to say, I think, is that if the precision _approaches_ infinity, the probability _approaches_ 0, but it is not _exactly_ 0, just something arbitrarily close to it.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
He just saved my from the brim of breaking down trying to understand SVD! What he presented is so natural, so beautiful that I instantly catch them. Appreciate MIT open courseware also!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Superb teacher!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is this calc 3?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You are so nice human being sir.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
damn i spent the entire explanation of gauss jordan wondering why it works but he wrapped it up so nicely in the end

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Ahhhhh, full of knowledge 😛

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Wait now i have a question supposed i got the eigenvalues if i used elimination and then i got the eigenvalues again. Would they be the same?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
finished just now .thanks prof.denis and mit ocw and cameraman/woman.camera focus was amazing😍🥰😘.am gonna miss his board cleaning unless i forget everything

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Likex100! These lectures are simply amazing.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No offense to the prof, but the geometric proof was way too convoluted than needed.   

P.S. I've learned calculus before, and just revising the topics.

### Lecture 25: Power Series and the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem
Thank you sir.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
this dude makes me happy aha

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
23 yrs ago i've learnt linear algebra from Strang's book , thanks sir.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Thank you Professor, i am a medicine doctor. I just wanted to learn linear algebra out of curiosity. Even I, who had not dealt with mathematics for a long time, was able to understand the subject. Thank you very much indeed.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
39:45 Taylor Series

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks so much for sharing those excellent courses!!!!! :)  I learned a lot from your open courseware!!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I know of no soft power more effective than these lectures. Thank you MIT for the generosity and commitment.

### 4. Counting
I found this helpful for understanding around t=20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WDUWCtxM1U

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is prof jerison. buaaaa!!!!! buaaa!!!!!


### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
your teaching is supper, sir, i never see before such knowledge any professor

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MY WORD THAT DOME

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I think this is love


### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Saving students from crappy Teachers since Nov 9, 2012... THANK YOU!!!
REPLY

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Around 6:40 6:40
              6:40 6:40

he says 2 equations, with 4 *unknowns*? Does he mean 4 variables, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4? Because x_1 and x_3 are in pivot columns and shouldn't be unknowns.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
44:43 Bayes' rule

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this is awesome.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
42:00-43:30

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
8th dimensional plane inside a 9th dimensional space. If the values of the 8th and 9th columns are same than it would like a plane over a plane like an onion. I am confused.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
you'll find that with everything like this, it's like a new years resolution. People go "I'm gonna learn linear algebra!" then a week later they forget about it

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you !  professor Strang

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
14:38, shouldn't that (1,1,1) be in the left nullspace of (A - I) instead of left nullspace of A as demonstrated in the tape？

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]you substitute z=x^2 so the higher power "quadratic" equation can be written as a actual quadratic equation az^2+bz+c.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Professor Strang, you're continuously amazing!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
But how is this useful?

### Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums
Is this video incomplete?

### 18. Markov Chains III
Thanks.  The MIT website provides pdfs of the prepared slides.  So the student can see a clear pdf side by side to the video on their computer. The pdf file can be downloaded.  Window placement can be side by side.  The State ID Numbers (IDs)are absent when I view the pdfs for this lecture.  The Professor John Tsitsiklis does refer to the IDs.  Some PDF readers including Adobe products can annotate with a text box the downloaded pdf.  You can add the same IDs fresh in your copy of the document.  The annotation can make the lecture easier to follow.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you Professor for an amazing lecture and MIT for publishing!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Great interview! Thanks for all your lectures

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
At 24:20 when he says that the multiplier goes directly into L, he means the negative right? If you keep a track of the operation on the left side, it inverts while bringing it to the right side.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Did he say toin coss instead of coin toss LOL

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn't students at MIT already know this?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was worrying about how tough and dense this lecture was, then the rest of the comments were reassuring! It all came clear in that final step too.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Of course it's going to be easy for a high schooler to understand this. It's the third lecture... People in that classroom only have high school math behind them.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
The summary is brief and billiant!, Ax=b, cool!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I want to self teach calculus 3 in a month, is it possible?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you!!!

Correction of error from previous lecture 0:43
Introduction to the four fundamental subspaces
(column space, null space, row space, left null space) 4:20
Basis and dimension of each fundamental subspace 11:44
Basis and dimension of the column space 12:50
Dimension of the row space (it is the rank) 14:41

LEGEND

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Gil flips his shit ... ~45:00

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
God bless you.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Ive watched all lectures in 18.06 and it's a shock to me how old Srang has grown. I pray that we can keep him forever. Please god, never take him from us.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
My guy be spittin'straight facts right there 👉

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]2:40, girl on the left.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I should be going to MIT

### 4. Counting
This is quite possibly the best lecture, and certainly the best explanation of how the formula for combinations is derived from the formula for permutations, that I've ever seen.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think khanacademy did a better video =) just my opinion, this video is helpful also =)

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Thanks Mit

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
if only in schools we could get that clarity of concept :'(

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
BEAUTIFUL 板书 ，neat！

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
very good but so slow ...

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
You are MIT and still using chalkboards?!!!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
When in our short lives would when ever use this-or even need to know it--just multiply numbers, divide them, add them subtract them and know how to figure out a percent-other than that the rest is all just bullcrap and worthless. It's mind games with no everyday use whatsoever. he's a nice guy and i expect from the comments he's good-but it's just mine games with no common use in our everyday lives.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Amazing lecture

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
God bless you sir. I see in this video professor Strang has injured his left hand. Yet he taught the class. I don’t know if any of the other viewers noticed that.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
The term universe is very and increasingly overused. Everything has to be clearly defined and understood. Outer “space” is not to be referred to as SPACE. Gravity, as it has been written, is an interaction. It is fundamental. The term inertia is now redefined as “inertia/inertial resistance”. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Einstein never nearly understood physics/physical experience. Here are the facts.

PRECISELY WHY AND HOW THE BALANCED, TOP DOWN, COMMON SENSE, SIMPLE, EXTENSIVE, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS PROVEN BY (AND CONSISTENT WITH) F=MA AND E=MC2:

The following also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution.

c squared represents a dimension of SPACE on balance WITH the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) (ON BALANCE); AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity. E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. I have exposed Einstein. Beautiful.

Note: Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Think carefully about the black “space” AS WELL. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. THE EYE represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) that is consistent with F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE. Consider what is necessarily, CLEARLY, logically, and by definition the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Think about what is true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY !!! Great.

Consider what is THE SUN. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.

The gravitational “field” is E=mc2 as F=ma. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) on balance. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. E=mc2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. That's the answer. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

Get a good LOOK at what are the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon AND the orange AND setting Sun. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. Lava is orange, and it is even blood red. THINK !!! SO, ON BALANCE, consider what are the tides !!! Excellent. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense; as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. Think about what is the BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AND consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !!! Wonderful. The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. The tides are CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE, as E=mc2 IS F=ma (ON/IN BALANCE).

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
While discussing 4th way of matrix multiplication, gives subtle hints so that it'll strike you that matrix multiplication is actually about the inner product of the column vectors of the 2 matrices (a^T×b).

What an absolute legend.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why lecture 2 has no audio.?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:00 When I was in U in Helsinki, Finland in 80's in comparable lecture the same question about generilization to higher dimension was asked and our lecturer gave almosty exactly the same answer as in here but augumented it with this: "One should invert a 100*100 matrix once in a lifetime to appriciate the fact that almost all multivariable mathematics can be reduced to two or three dimensions."

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
@[USERNAME]ish.. If I am understanding correctly, limiting distribution is not always Gaussian. There might be cases when CLT isn't valid such as when n is small. Are there any other cases? And how were the bounds defined for kiss example? If someone can explain, I would appreciate it.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Is there any one one who can help me which book or slides this course is based on? It would be very great, thank you.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Column picture is my favorite 🤓💯👍

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
24:27 the author explains that since 1-cos(theta) goes to 0 while theta goes to 0 and considers this a proof. This is not. Because theta goes to 0 also. This limit can't be proven geometrically, because both quantities are going to 0 and even if 1-cos(theta) is presumably much less then theta, it doesn't mean the ratio of them equals to 0, from this geometric construction. Maybe it is equal to 0.0000000000001. So, unfortunately the lim (1-cos(theta))/(theta) = 0 remains mathematically unproven. The prove can be derived from the first remarkable limit (sin(x)/x ---> 1) and fact that cos(x) = 1-2*sin(x/2)*sin(x/2). I leave the proof to the reader as a 2 minutes home work.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

Where can I get the slides used in the video?

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
What does it mean when the projection matrix is trying to be the identity matrix?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
One thing I didn't understand. When he solved for A transpose ..2nd row becomes 0 because it's dependent on 1st row ..4th row also became 0 but it doesn't depend on any other row.. he said that row of 0's means that original row is a combination of other rows ..but 4th row is not a combination so why it became 0??? Please help if anyone knows the answer!

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
came here from 18.06 fall 2011 Singular value decomposition taught by Professor Strang

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can we diff tan inverse  using definition of differentiation 

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
To be clear that I'm not missing something in the lecture, he assumes exp(lambda*t) is a solution to the matrix differential equation BEFORE he has explained what a matrix exponential is or shown how it might be derived, correct?

I'm asking because I want to make sure I'm not missing some section of the video.

I went back and watched parts of it multiple times and I think he is skipping around at some places in a way that makes it hard to follow, even if you're familiar with differential equations and the material up to this point.  I generally like his broad and conceptual approach but in this video I believe there were too many jumps from one line of thought to another.

Nonetheless, once I got past some of the excessive handwaviness, the overall approach to decoupling differential equations is excellent and I learned a lot.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
OK, we're executing a determinant formula here. lol!

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
the first lecture has 580k viewers, and lecture 23 has 30k viewers? Are those people really want to learn something?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
"I'm sorry that's on tape" Strang 2005

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you, thank you a lot. I live in Spain and now I can studied Algebra thank to this videos.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
for the proof of the limit of (1-cos(x))/x - > 0, why doesn't he just use the sin(x)/x limit he just used beforehand?  Seriously,  take the expression for: sin^2(x/2) is equivalent to (1/2)(1-cos(x)), multiply both sides of the identity by 2,  then bring in the x denominator, and divide top and bottom of left side by 2, giving: (sin(x/2))(sin(x/2)/(x/2)).  Limit of a product is product of limits = (0)(1) = 0?

I know the answer is to prove it geometrically,  however he could prove it with identities, and tell the student to look up a book if they required a more rigorous explanation - assuming that's not in an exam!

Note: I do really like these videos. 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The only requirements to go to college (or University in my case) is willingness and money, in this case, money is no concern. But the requirement to GRADUATE and CONTINUE in college is different. So they all deserve to go if they wanted.

dang i am in precal class, wanting to get a jump start on calculus, and none of this or lecture one made any sense, he kept talking about limits and derivitaves and even showed examples, but never explained how to get them that well, or even what they were....have the ppl in this class had previous exposure to this stuff?

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
okay this was extremely useful! 
revising for exam for discrete mathematics first year at the University of Bath, and  from 16:25 best way of thinking of fast fourier transforms and matrices that i have heard!! very simple, well explained, he's a great lecturer.

@[USERNAME]of course, i can't even begin to understand most of them and their complexities, i think they are useless unless you wana become some linear algebra lecturer.

### 25. Classical Inference III
be thankful

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
how many times has watching a lecture brought a smile to your face ? I was constantly smiling - every time he pointed out something that I hadn't thought of in the way he mentions it. Such an amazing teacher!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Boardseption

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
In the original example we treated used all of the identity elements (1,0;0,1) in the solution (x), but in the transpose we just reduce it to "1". Why?

Amazing lecture!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thank you professor Gilbert Strang.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Erm, on their website where these videos are uploaded, it says they were recorded in the Fall of 1999. Yet in the youtube videos, they are from 2005. Which is the correct date? ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
if you belive the law of cosine, its a proof of the dot product. If you belive in the dot product but not in the law of cosine, then its a proof of the law of cosine. But if you don't belive in neither of them like me, then its a bit harder...

Now I LOVE IT!!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is kinda boring, I mean, if we're going to be engineers, there's no way we're gonna do exercises like this. It doesn't have any application.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Audio channels fixed!

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Partial fractions starts at 0:45 until 18:20, which is also important.

can anyone tell me that how R is rotated by 90 degree , is R a vector too ?? it is just a matrix right ? it would be great help if someone can help ....

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Pure math man


### 3. Parametric Inference
If you take this class my advice is first dont let this be your first stat class, you will be in trouble. This professor might be super clear if you already know what he is explaining but if you dont, he is a terrible professor. The only ones that do good are the ones that already took other courses. He knows his stuff of course, but he is not an efficient communicator, he cant clearly think in the student perspective, and his TAs are just like him too. You will be dazed and confused, just a fair warning.. Plus adding to the above he also makes several mistakes in what he writes, and has the annoying habit of speeding up and talking fast as the content gets more complicated, instead of doing the exact opposite like a professor should. Case in point, at 47:04 professor changes variables to x, should be y. Its a small detail right? But this in newly introduced concepts can cause confusion, and put this together with a fast pace, and you will be struggling a lot of things that are quite easy, but because his communication skills are lacking, the easy becomes confusing and difficult fast.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
lets do some base 8 octal trigonometry for fun and double check our binary conversions then run a hexadecimal sequence for simple trig so we can fast track it as brain only math once hardwired in neural think the jump to quantum consciousness it only a spark away

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Question: around the 22:00 mark when he divides the second pivot point by two, why does that change not have to be subtracted from the previous row the same way multiples were being treated for the rest of the equation? Is it just because the other values in that column are already equal to 0?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 15:21, isn't the right hand side the derivative of a constant quantity (the magnitude of the vector r) and therefore always zero?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the component of F opposite the direction T is what causes the pendulum to move, and the component of F opposite the direction of N is responsible for the tension, perhaps this is what he said but perhaps not

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much both to MIT and Prof Denis Auroux

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Could the camera show the blackboard for a second? It's just stupid how he asks ''does this matrix have an inverse'' and you have to rewind and pause in order to see the matrix, it would be a bit much to ask one to remember everything he says when there is a lot of new information presented.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Please help.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
23:57 What a genius. I love this lessons.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]omg! he really fucking said that. oh man, this guy...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
这个老师讲的很好，有些学生似乎基础有点差

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
When professor Stang says that A = uV^T, I suspect that u is the pivot column and V^T is the pivot row. Am I right? But nonetheless, the lecture is fantastic as usual and these truly are a gift. Thanks a lot professor Strang and MIT.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM FOR HIS CALCULS ON THE WEB.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
OMG!!! Best way to understand least square!!!

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 24:54 he uses for the arc length of the ellipse the same formula we would for a circle... I think there's a constant missing there.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
21:25 Inverses

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Wonderful explanation for Buffon's needle problem. Thanks a lot.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah, why not, accent can be funny and also interessting

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture is particularly fun. The students are way more reactive in particular.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
he is a legend.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Beware of his explanation of y= x².  There is a well-defined method of handling this situation where units are treated as mathematical objects.  If x represents some real number times centimeters, like 5cm, then x² = 25cm².  There is no other correct interpretation.  Therefore, y = 25cm², and is an area.  If, like mafl25 writes, he really means the square of the "magnitude", then he should realize that a number without a unit _has_ no magnitude—it's just a number.  Is 10 a big number?  Or is it a small number?  What is its magnitude?  If y is really the square of the "coefficient" of x, then he must isolate the coefficient by dividing x by cm.  That is, he should write y=(x/cm)² cm, or y=x²/cm.  If you then carry out the rest of the problem, treating units as mathematical constants, you will arrive at the correct solution with the correct units.  This is common practice in solving physics problems.  Always be strict and always get the right answer.  There is no paradox here.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Sound is very low and 

Handwriting also not perfect visible.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The more I watch these videos, the more I hate the cameraman

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Fantastic lecture, really appreciate MIT sharing the course lectures for free.

### 13. Bernoulli Process
I've never come across a more eloquent, immaculate and lucid introduction to random processes before. It's a blessing to have the opportunity to listen to your lecture, Prof. Tsitsiklis. :)

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Be nice guys. They're freshman just starting, after a long summer.

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
I can’t say   I will have to review and review from beginning to end many times. You are most clear in explanations.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Brilliant leacture

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is awesome, i feel like a student in the class :)

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Well i have studied these at the Technion isreal instittute of technology its an easy subject

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why does P0P have a dot product of 0 with N but the vector P does not have a dot product of 0 with N if the normal vector is supposed to be perpendicular to every vector in the plane?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Looking at the comment section, I feel pretty dumb for barely feeling any intuition in whatever Prof. Strang said.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is no issue of rotification of the formula, it depends on understanding to explain it to those who are learners. If a person rotifies all formulae but unable to understand to explain it to the learners would not bring forward any results to educate them.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Finally a Real Analysis course. Thanks MIT.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Where was the energy equation mentioned in previous lectures?

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
at 29:57 wouldn't the center of gravity of the pmf be (n+1)/2 not n/2  because the numerical values start at 0, not 1, so there are n+1  numerical values of uniform frequency. the middle would be (n+1)/2 no?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
my head is spinning.....

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
sigma 1 >= sigma 2

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
at 20:35, why use the positive square roots instead of negative ones?

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh dear God, I can't believe this awaits me in college. Well, time to break out the red bull.

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
Chalk slip at 32:02 I think 0 + x = x, not 0 + x = 0
This is the advantage of having an audience, because most people would have pointed this out I think. Edit: He caught it at about 42:00.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
26:35 ☺️

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i just skipped to 5 mins but I noticed something. Why tell people to use a calculator when you can solve that for e. when you do y=(1+1/k)^k take log on both sides lny=kln(1+1/k) use l'hospitals to get k and go back to e to solve and you get e^k

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Knowledge with Humility! <3

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Is that French accent?

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]f''(ln(1+x)) is -1/(1+x) not -1/(1+x)^2. f''(0) is still -1. Correct me if I'm wrong!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
29:48

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
37:20 Define H(x) := F(x) - G(x), then H(b) - H(a)/ b-a = H'(c) for at least one c in (a,b) by MVT. Since H'(x) = F'(x) - G'(x) and F'(x) = G'(x) we have H'(x) = 0 and therefore H(x) = constant, i.e. F(x) = G(x) + constant.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thank you professor Gilbert Strang and MiT for this absolutely fabulous series on linear algebra, for the benefit of students all over the world. This, for me,  is USA at its very best. Greetings from Trondheim , Norway.

wow! Watching computational formula for determinant emerging out of the three basic rules of determinant is the most wonderful thing in this series.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
newtons method is beautiful. its such an efficient algorithm to use with so many applications. 

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's an interesting lecture.... But at some points it is little confusing..... :-)

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
@[USERNAME]In this perspective, look at the matrix by rows, every row corresponds to an edge. And the first three rows, if see it in the graph, make a loop.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
the power of the test shouldn't it be 95% ? 1-alpha ?

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
at 41:20, why the rank 1 matrix has 2 zero eigenvalues?  because 3 - 1 = 2? does the professor mean that number of zero eigenvalues always equals to nullity of that matrix?

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Like his explanation of how a normal distribution can be constructed by adding direction (negations), width controls (sigma^2), and nomalizers (so that integral is 1). I always had trouble remembering the normal distribution, now I don't anymore.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
"Statistics is about replacing expectations with averages. That is what all of statistics is about."

I finally understand that lecture clearly.  That is beginning of Calculus 2 because fist half of semester covers entire Calculus 1.  I took Calculus 2 (MAT 205) at Gallaudet University but professor did not teach clearly and I failed course.  I re-took Calculus 2 with different professor and finally passed a course.  That is great lectures!!  Thanks, MIT!

When we lump more than 1 state into a class, and find the probability of entering the lump or the time needed to reach that lump: how do we calculate the values for individual states within the lump?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Math surprises you everytime...🤔 Never thought that connections between rate of growth in system dynamics, fibonacci Series and diagnalization of an INDEPENDENT vectors will finally boil down INTO GOLDEN RATIO OF EIGENVALUES at END! 😳

35:54: Like a boss. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
... It's called vectors, you'll learn about them later. To add vectors you put them tip to tail and draw a vector from the tail of the first to the tip of the last. So in this case, when you put them tip to tail, it forms a rectangle. Then when you draw the "resultant" vector, it is the diagonal of the rectangle.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'd love to know if MIT teaches tabular integration?  Probably not, because it's not a "rigorous"  method.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
“Take a breath and listen up!” - lecturer’s perspective starting vector spaces.  👍 I just love Gilbert Strang! I completely agree. I will tell that to my students tomorrow. 🙏

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
These ugly people come with their own inner limitation to what we call walk
..... They say blame not a man in his trail to the mountain
It's what he does in the community first and he finds itself at the mountain when everyone else could only guess what was taken.
They're too nasty for eternal feed..... Numeral matters are based the same
..... They don't get their on their own

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Maths is not limited to formulas and algebra, it's about insights and thought process, and that makes it beautiful. Thanks Prof Gilbert Strang for wonderful lectures

11:20 deserve a clap

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Dose anyone know in which lecture he talked about Jacobian or Hessian matrix

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
You must first explain what are the applications of  linear algebra ...then students will get connected to the subject.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
sorry to disappoint you but it's d(sigma) not dS. that MIT guy needs a reanimation.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I just found that the way Strang talks sounds a bit like David Lynch. Anyone agrees?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
d/dx (1/v)=0. What’s he talking about?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Great lecture. Thank you!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes but you should do Calc problems as well to get in down.

### 13. Bernoulli Process
ha ha... Past Time of the Bernoulli's were to flip coins!! It made me laugh so loud!! Great humor sir!! :D :D

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Prof. Strang's style is amazing. He keeps you curios, suspended and involved the whole time.

### 34. Final Course Review
I love the moment when the prof spotted the solution 3, 3, 4 and exclaimed “it works!”. Eureka!

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Excellent way to introduce the concept of random process.

### 16. Markov Chains I
I love this man

### 14. Poisson Process I

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof. Denis Auroux and MIT thankyou!!!!

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I beg you MIT, please upload the rest of the Calculus lectures. One of the most fundemental classes for math and science and they have only about a third of it up. ;-()

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Ok guys don't complain about the difficulty of this section. You're gonna need some differential equation knowledge in order to fully understand this one, and the next one (FFT). E.g. solving a system of differential equation. Prof Strang did a fantastic job on that which I've never used a linear algebra point of view to understand system of differential equations and stabilities.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
11:00 There is a ghost on a board, in a right lower corner of it.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
People complaining about the cameraman dont know that the blackboard is more important to see? lol

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
22 minutes in, still waiting for the hard part; that's the genius of Gilbert Strang.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
a 'couple' doesn't turn their heads right. only 1 person of the couple does it in the end. if there are n couples, there are 2n individuals who can go Left or Right. that's the amount you have to look at right?edit: retarded because both people do kiss in the same direction. bye

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 16:21 Why does function depends only on one direction if 4ac - b^2 = 0 ? Yes the term with y^2 is 0 but don't we have y in first term as well? (x + b/2a * y)^2

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thank you, MIT OCW team! Thank you, Dr. Rodriguez! These videos will change a lot of people's lives. It's a great contribution to the education!

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
What are X_1, X_2....X_n? Is each X_i a single measurement, or a bunch of measurements (of let's say Penguin height)?


EDIT: Now that I think of it, a single measurement is also a subset of "bunch of measurements"

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

Thank you MIT, you guys are the best in spreading knowledge to human kind =)) This is epic!!! I feel like being a student of one of the top institute in the world without paying extremely high tuition!

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What textbook does this class use?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why only  "Invertible A" at 6:06???

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hmm... They have 1200 videos up already. They may not be terribly organized, but that's what the search bar is for.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
How did he get all the equations of xk, yk and fk at 45:35? Specifically, how did he get (b-1)/(b+1) and vice versa? I shifted the equation to make xk+1 and yk+1 the subjects of the equations but instead I got xk+1 = xk (1-2sk), where xk = x0 = b.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Love him. But always the same pants(nothing wrong with them). And the desk?, so ugly

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
My favourite US mathematicians are Gil and the late, great Eli Stein from Princeton.  Lovely people and great mathematical communicators. When doing proofs Eli used to say things  like: "Morally this has to be right!"  For a small homage to Gil on SVD go here: https://gotohaggstrom.com/Singular%20Value%20Decomposition%20worked%20numerical%20examples.pdf

### 34. Final Course Review
Thumbs up if you have a final coming up and you are watching this.


### 3. Parametric Inference
Is he disabled or why is he using this retarded bike all time?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Is this course usefull for machine learning ?

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Too much talk and not enough example. He doesn't not go through one single basic example to help understanding the subject. He just repeats what is said on intorduction to probablity by Dimitri Berteskas. Just read the book is just as good as watching this video. Unless u know the subject very well, I would not recommend watching the video

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
hey!my left ear can be smarter too!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
rich people.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Denis is the best teacher I have ever seen!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I can't believe I'm watching this for entertainment at my own will. He's probably the greatest math teacher I've ever had

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is sad for me to see how much i could learn some years ago if i have acces to his class.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
He looks great considering the lectures were from 1876.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
"Always ready for questions."
I've watched every one of these lectures and I don't think anyone has ever asked a single question.  Kind of odd.

### 12. Time Complexity

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
OMG, best ever explanation of maximum likelihood estimator!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He is really easy to understand...if you've ever heard someone talk with a foreign accent before, you could tell his accent is very understandable. Plus, he's a great teacher, get used to it.

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
Such a cute Professor, going back and forth, a dilemma of continuing doing use cases or discovering the formula. 🐼

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's just easy that's why you like this 1 perhaps others may be Better than this but you are not worth enough to understand that difficulties 😏

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
where can i access the slides?

Thanks sir
Jesus is the Son of God. Believe in his death and resurrection then confess his lordship over your life. Love yall🙏♥️

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
this got a whole lot less interesting as soon as we started talking about current and physics

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I had a professor like him

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
¿Que mierda dicen?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Too many who comment here seem to think this too fundamental for a great technical school like MIT.  The sad truth is that most high schools do an atrocious job of teaching Calculus.  So bad, in fact, that a growing number of universities now virtually insist that the subject be retaken under a competent instructor.  Poor preparation in mathematics tends to feed upon itself, for in mathematics, virtually everything depends upon the thorough mastery of that which came before.  Shall we now pretend that our secondary education in the USA is not the worst in the industrialized world?  Shall we forget that our secondary school educators, with rare exception, are among the most incompetent of those who own college degrees?  And yet, we somehow are willing to trust the instruction of this important topic to these institutions without reservation!  Further, I would not hesitate to suggest that only someone who staggered  through though Calculus in a mechanical, inartful way would fail to appreciate a fine presentation such as this.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like this video. I think it's great that I don't have to pay to learn calculus

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Can anyone please tell me where do I get the problem sets??

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Gilbert Strang a legend

### 3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph
Oh man, these probabilistic proofs are so ****ing beautiful.....are they intrinsically equivalent to some kind of counting?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
10:30.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This lecture plus 3blue1brown's videos are getting these concepts to stick for me. Thank you Prof. Strang!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love these lectures!!! Now I'll be able to get ahead in my highschool math!!
THANK YOU MIT!!!!!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Im happy to see how healthy his mind is, its impressive how body deteriorates but mind can last forever if well kept.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
His clothes reminded me of Walter Lewin, lol!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
note: row*matrix=row, (abc)(3*3)=a(row1)+b(row2)+c(row3), matrix*column=column, (3*3)(abc)=a(col1)+b(col2)+c(col3)
(a11 to a33)(3*3)=({(a11,a12,a13)(3*3)}, {...}, {...})=({a11(row1)+a12(row2)+a13(row3)}, {...}, {...}), we can represent elimination by Matrices.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
39:45 not that serious paradox if (constant with) correct dimensions were used, e.g.: 'y = x^2 (1/m)' or 'y = c x^2' with 'c = 1/m' (from 'c = m / m^2')) (see https://www.mathcha.io/editor/7rrGpc0WSLdHDxZdJHGXxY0Gun6zLQQSq2wd3 )

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you so much Dr.Gilbert,
I am a 12 year old boy in the middle east with a special interest for math, and your teaching methods are quite clear even for a person of my age, with a brief background in differentials, derivatives, and other relatively basic things in pre-calculus (hoping to understand integrals by the end of the next 2 months!!)
Once again, Thank you soooo much, I cannot express how happy I am to finally find an amazing mathematical-based professor!!!!

P.S. I would also recommend Dr.Eddie Woo and Dr.Edward Burger for any more math!!

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the teacher also must tell the students that are a little lost what is the meaning of their answer for instance at 5 feet the water is raising 1/2pi he could show that the volumen of water is 2 per minute which means also that at a higher point the raising of water will be even less. this sort of explanations will make the students to understand better all these answers.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
49:36 did he flip someone off?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
where is the online homework ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
😒  indian teachers are much better.....
....
...

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Gilbert Strang is extremely likeable.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
The best linear algebra teacher in the world now is going to  teach us how to apply this concepts in real world problems . I can't thank enough MIT OCW and professor Strang for this.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It was an accident. He ended up correcting it later.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the sound of chalk on a chalkboard.. he has great handwriting

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
man the students in this lecture are either slow or dont like to shout out answers on camera lol

### 17. Markov Chains II
Great lecture. One of my favorite professors.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Love Prof.Strang so much!!!really excellent lecture!!!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I got confused when he says length of vector with magnitude of vector ..
I guess magnitude is only valid to find the length of one vector only..
Because I guess it cannot do dot product with other vector to find it's length/magnitude..
So we need to find it using pythogoras theorem..i.e find the hypotenuse..
The problem is simpler if you have more than one vector..
Just do the dot product and you get the length

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Good

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I have fallen for Dr. Strang. He is actually Dr. Strange. 💗 I don't know how he gives me some feeling through these videos. Only kudos....👏.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks so much Prof Auroux and MIT, clear explanations and for free! May god bless this university

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why was everyone clapping

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Don't complain whiners. There are TWO whole courses after this one that teach JUST applied linear algebra. 

1. Computational Science and Engineering I
2. Mathematical Methods for Engineers II

You can also read the book - Introduction to Linear Algebra, AND another entire book just for advanced applications - Computational Science and Engineering, both by Prof. Strang.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
at 32:40...the professor says...oh god, come out correctly!  and a moment later, aha, thank you, God.  haha...

### 11. Recursion Theorem and Logic
was watching some gaming vids, fell asleep with autoplay on and woke up to this

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
That guy who is always capturing the photo

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great series, sadly spoiled by bad camera zooms :(

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
i just spent 8 hours looking at this videos and now that i check the problems from my school i am on the start again just wasted 8h...how can USA and EU have such different uses and concepts of matrix it suks donkey balls


### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is too easy ,in fact !

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah! I understand vector calculus clearly! Good job, teacher!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks to MIT for sharing the knowledge for free!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks, thanks, Thanks!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
The best teacher ever. I really admire the act of MIT. Like in a phrase in its website: "Unlocking Knowledge, Empowering Minds."

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's funny how the professor just throws these AMAZING examples as if they are nothing. :P 
42:26 "That's actually relatively easy to do given all of the power that we have in our hands."

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
what a great professor

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If 4ac - b^2 = 0, then the y^2 component disappears. However, you still have the x and y inside the first term, which you square. I don't get how it's degenerate. What if W = x^2 + 2xy + y^2? 4ac = 4, and b^2 = 4, so 4ac - b^2 = 0. However, it doesn't have a degenerate critical point.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
That feeling, when you find every thing you need in a MIT course. Much respect  Prof.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Thank you so much MIT and Professor Strang!

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy is french right??

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
First lecture of the series that I've slightly struggled with :( I understand the second derivative test, and how to carry it out, but in the specific quadratic function example, why does a "difference of two squares" imply a saddle point? I see how a sum of two squares implies a local min or max depending on the value of a, but confused about how the algebra leads to the conclusion that we have a saddle. Also not quite clear on the degenerate case and why 4ac - b^2 = 0 implies degeneracy. Need to do some further reading on this before moving on methinks... 

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Thanks Dr Strang. Really Enjoyed the lectures

### 25. Classical Inference III
Finally, thank you professor J.T

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
From the bottom of my heart I want to thank MIT and the professors for creating such beautiful and elegant videos. They are hands down the only reason I understand this topic because my professor unfortunately can explain it as clearly as you guys have presented it or at least the way he presents the lecture isn’t my style.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I remember writing a comment "I am 9th grade and these lectures are awesome". But now when I am in a university and completed a calculus course, my opinion changed from awesome to good.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
great teacher (Y) very friendly

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Shouldn't the last pivet be -5

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So have most Americans.  Not everyone in MIT is a math major.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
30 minutes into the lecture and he is already talking about unions. the left has seized academia firmly in it's grip

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
We do that in high school in French --'
But good teacher btw

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:00
CROSS PRODUCT

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is it only me or do others who know calculus feel that the students are asking questions just for you sake of asking and there is no genuine doubt as such

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Monica joke is just awesome!!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No jodas!!

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How can I calculate volumen of a solid of revolution generated by a curve turned aroun an inclined line?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
That first lecture had hundreds of thousands of views. This one has less than 100,000 still. Let's see how many views there will be in lecture 30 lol

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is how teaching should be, and it´s the only way that it works, going from example and observation, in order to understand what happens, and then go into abstraction. Not going from presenting abstraction and applying it to an example.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
We love you Sir ❤🧡💛. Stay Safe.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is some kind of magician of mathematics 😮

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Maan, this person is just a cool dude mathematician

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Currently a sophomore in high school. I've heard a lot about calculus over the years and about just how powerful and beautiful it is. About 20 minutes in is when that rang so true for me.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
there is some math humor at minute 32:46. 
I never knew about "the column picture" (which is very good) until I met this course.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Haha, I guess I'm challenging that demographic then since I'm a student using this as a supplement to my class XD

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Thank you MIT. Please consider uploading more lecture series in abstract mathematics (e.g. real analysis, complex analysis, abstract algebra, differential geometry, topology, ...) It will be of great help to us!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
After watching this lecture, all I can say is how truly amazed I am. What a great video! Except for the fact that I couldn't understand one word he was saying( currently taking Tech Math at HS). I mean the camera was on point, his writing was nice, and the students were quite polite. Superb! MIT you surely do not disappoint :D

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Thanks so much. Notice much more white hair than the videos in 2008:((

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Why would the lack of pivot make the corresponding variable free?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I didn't know Bob Barker taught linear algebra.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
One thing that I cannot figure out if somebody can help me. The projection is supposed to be A times that x hat. but when we solve, he does A^TAx = A^Tb. But that is not p, p would be A times all of that, wouldn't it?

### 34. Final Course Review
The ending of a great semestre, thank you professor Gilbert, because of you, I started to like Algebra and I'm sure I can do the course, keep up the great work!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This class/course seems to be so organized and planned. Just pissed that I'm studying at a PBL institution right now where its just madness and chaos.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Several Questions:

1.  What is calculus?
2.  Does multi-variable calculus exist?
3.  Should calculus be re-written and given a field?
4.  Then should it only stick with the subject?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did i miss anything,or did he actually prove quotient rule?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

No, in Zenon's Paradox there is convergence. In this case there is not.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For anyone who may be confused in the first part of this video, it helps to keep in mind that he is talking specifically about a function with a tangent plane z=0 at the origin. Also keep in mind what the graphs of x^2 - y^2 and x^2 + y^2 look like!

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I agree.  I have watched this series up to this point and though I can't say that he is not trying or is incorrect...nevertheless his treatment of the material is just too pedantic and never addresses the real issues.  This is especially apparent when he tries to answer questions from the students he seems to skirt the real stumbling blocks.  Combined with his twitchy mannerisms makes it hard to follow.  It's instruction like this that turned me off of math throughout my schooling.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
1:12:57 
Some serious mental arithmetic going on there xD  😂😂

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
i really don't know who still goes to school?:-)

thank you, mit guys!

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
very useful and helpful i'd say
thanks MIT.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Prof. Strang is such a good professor! Good pace and he explains it in a very clear and easy to understand way. Thank you so much!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can someone explain the proof again at the end? howd he get f'(x0).0?

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Anthony Fantano covering math, I'm so happy.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
nice proof better than my maths prof


### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
It's funny that this video (lec 7) has vastly fewer views than both lecture 6 and  8. But if the title of this video was PCA instead of Eckart-Young it would easily be the most viewed video in the series.

That's why kids, do the entire course instead of just watching 15 minutes of popular concepts.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.


### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]i think the cameraman usually falls asleep. maybe he's a professional who doesnt understand a word of maths, so he gets annoyed and takes small naps

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
One thing to rule them all
One thing to find them
One thing to bring them all
And in a matrix bind them

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Whew. Not easy. So the gradient vector is perpendicular to the level curves, so can be drawn on the contour plot of the function, NOT the graph of the function itself (?)...took me a while to realise this, so my thinking was at cross purposes with what he was saying. Also this business of "velocity vectors" and the vector r I found a bit confusing...think I've got the concept of a directional derivative though. Need to do some more reading on this...

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
@[USERNAME]You don't really need to know about differential equations to understand this lecture. Just watch lessons 1 to 20 as well ;-). Takes you only 15h :-D.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Great video! Just one question. At the very end when talking about Variances. I know he said it is two lines of algebra, but how did he get from the sum of [(distance from the mean) * p(X)] to E[X^2] - [E(X)]^2 ??

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
特徵值，特徵向量

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The whole point is that something continuous, and smooth/analogue in nature requires a digital limit for its description and modelling.  I used the wrong word, "plug in".  I should not have used that terminology.  The fact of the matter is that from a floating point standpoint, you can only come as close as you would like to an exact answer, vis-a-vis, the limit, while never achieving exactitude from an emperical point of view.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Professor Strang for this amazing course! I spend around 2 months on it, taking notes, watching recitations, and solving those problems on the OCW website. It demonstrates the charm of maths, unique, inspiring, brilliant, makes me calm down and ignore all those annoying things in daily life, and just enjoy this journey!

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sorry sir but f =s not f

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Jesus Christ he's great at teaching.  I now understand the difference between spending $50,000 per year and $10,000 per year. At least they're paying for the tuition so I get to watch these videos for free.

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
Camera man ....Follow Prof Strang!!!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It helps, also, if they have a unique personality, like this guy does.  I watched all these linear algebra videos and it was a pleasure watching this professor in action because it was entertaining.  No disrespect.  

### 34. Final Course Review
What are  the prerequisites in order to take this course ?

I just passed out standard 10th , now i am in standard 11th. School has not started yet . Please guide.

35:32 "ok you are easily amused" 😂 lolz

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When he solves for the area of the triangle, why does he say it doesn't matter what X0 and Y0 are? Does he just mean that all values of f(x) = 1/x will result in the area of the triangle of the tangent line to be 2?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did this in 8th grade lol @ mit students

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Thank you Gilbert Strang !!!

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
This man is literally my favorite professor! His course on linear algebra saved me. I had really, really, low self-esteem and didn’t think much of myself, and somehow, he made me appreciate math again. I watched the first video in his series because I was looking for a cheap win, but his way of taking time to make us truly see the bigger picture really got through to me. No one in my family could get through to me but him, through his lectures. Thank you sir! You’re a real one ☝🏽🙌🏽❤️✨🤓🥳🎊 the og Superman

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow..so clean now..thanks..

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture is such a jumbled mess.
At @13:20 the prof. defines the mystery base e such that d/dx (e^x) = e^x.
At @21:34 the prof. states that e is the base of the logarithm. (e is Euler's number)
How does he equate the e at @13:20 with the e at @21:34? He assumes that they are the same just because he has used the same letter in both places. There is not explanation as to why the logarithm base 'e' is the same as the mystery base 'e' defined earlier.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:30

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
40:30 نقطة جدا جدا جدا مهمة

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Good lecturer.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
This is why people applied MIT

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what about what was written behind the boards?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Prof. Strang is amazing but you should skip this lecture if you are NOT familiar with differential equations. It is too fast paced, and avoids multiple non-distinct eigenvalues. I didn't find the book section very helpful as well. 
The good thing is skipping this "applications" lecture doesn't affect the series. I would recommend Edwards-Penney differential equations Chapter 5 if you really want to understand what is going on and where these equations are coming from (i.e. the link between eigenvectors, exponential matrices and different equations). 
You can look at ocw 18.03 section 4 as well, which will explain this at a reasonable pace.
or you can just leave thinking aside and put the following things into memory.
A system of differential equations has a solution in the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A. Exponential of a matrix is a taylor series with scalar replaced by a matrix and follows the same derivative. For stability, real part of eigenvalues has to be negative.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
13.00  that idea  never came to me

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The only reason I can see that you'd be opposed to this is perhaps if you think that American workers and businesses cannot keep up? Or just threatened and xenophobic of non-Americans? Well, if rising standards serves as a motivation, then American businesses have to step up their games and become better. Which is better for you.

It's not all about direct national interest. And as an international student who is not going to MIT, I greatly appreciate this gesture (which doesn't cost them much).

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
thank you sir.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I mean I know this is MIT but if at 9:40 he would just do factoring without skipping steps, it would be much clearer for everyone and he wouldn't have to go over everything to make sure people understood.

### 16. Markov Chains I
This is the best introduction to markov chains ever!!!!!!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Like like like 👍👍👍👍

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
At the last proof (A'A is invertible), why is he allowed to multiply both sides by a row vector? Shouldn't that change the solution set?

For example, suppose [x1 x2 x3 x4]' = 0. Then x = 0 vector. But if I multiply both sides by [1 -1 0 0], then [1 1 0 0]' becomes a solution. Should I assume that this operation can only add solutions, so the proof is still valid (since after the operation, only 0 is in the nullspace)?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
i wish they didnt move the cameras so much, i want to look at the blackboard, i don't mind if the professor is not in frame.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
I am not entirely sure if this is correct ( plz say if I am not), but I’m also pretty sure U, sigma, and v-transpose can also be called LDL-transpose or also LDU for L is lower D diagonal and U for upper

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
after lec4, it feels like passing the right and clean side of the notebook

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Something about Frobenius Profesor

### 34. Final Course Review
Can't believe I made it to the last lecture. Thank you professor Strang.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
am i the only one who thinks it odd to introduce derivatives before limits?

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lol thats stupid that they are teaching those easy stuff in MIT.they must know all those easy shit from highscool

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
I'm currently reading Calculus by Dr. Strang. One of the best books on the subject I have ever come across.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Thank you Professor Strang for the great course, and MIT for making it accessible for us. This is such a great opportunity for those of us who want to learn more than what is offered at our high schools.

### 4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions
Warning: The difficulty rose exponentially in this lecture >.<

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am very happy to why the fuck is this full of bots in space and curl. Thank you, it really helps

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
i just had one of those OOOOOOOOh moments

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
it would be better if the professor has provided a proof for the fundamental theory of calculus rather then just stating it and then providing examples.

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
Great lecture! Thanks professor and MIT.

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
DR. Strang, thank you once again for another fantastic lecture on Matrices A(t) Depending on t. Using calculus to find dlamba/dt  is another great work of art by the grandfather of linear algebra.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Knowledge for free. Thanks MIT, thanks youtube, thanks internet.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
The joke at the end was likely very effective in making students interested and curious about the topic. What a genius!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Spinning in or spinning out? This is the question.

### 34. Final Course Review
I completed the course. Thank you, professor, so much.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
27:16 can someone explain to me abit more about the height "r" ?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
i think this lecture changed my life ...i now see education in a morer good perspection...by the way am from south africa ..stellenbosch university

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Audio channels fixed!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
47:33 b0ss music plays.........

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
You make teachers in my university look like trash

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
the pseudoinverse is denoted A+.  Prof. Strang said pseudoinverses wouldn't be on the final exam.  Therefore there were no A+'s on the final.  :/ ...

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
How did sir prove that column rank = row rank by just decomposing the matrix into CR? Thanks

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
THE BEST IN THE GAME!!! THE BEST IN THE GAME!

### 25. Classical Inference III
Wonderful lesson, beautiful teachings, Prof. Thanks!

### 34. Final Course Review
Professor Strang, I would like to humbly thank you for sharing this invaluable knowledge with all of us. And of course, thank you MIT for uploading such amazing content. I spent the last 2.5 months watching all the videos, preparing all 10 problem sets, 3 quizzes, and the final exam. I even uploaded my solutions here - https://github.com/alivay/mit_1806_linear_algebra in latex and pdf formats.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
More functional analysis courses please!! more advanced functional analysis courses! perhaps even non-linear functional analysis :D

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the way mathematics should be taught explaining every logical step. Sadly it's lightyears away from the way it's usually taught.

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My multivariable calculus class in Spain was at least 2 times harder than this, the entire carreer was 5 years long and it was FREE. People without resources even get extra money for transport etc.. of course this is already being fucked up because of your uncontrolled capitalism generated crisis, I used to think about MIT as something big and smart but it isn't.. the lectures are the same, even easier than in many other places.. you live indebted selling yout entire lives for nothing.. 

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
auroux ftw.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Prof. Strang. Thank you sir!!!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Never learned determinants like this, always just given the formula and the applications. Very enlightening.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
buders daha iyi

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
My Monica distance is too small 😂😭 Professor Strang comin’ at us with all that humor towards the end was fun 🧡🙌🏽✨

### Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems
I think in the last mct, we also need assumption that f be nonnegative on E, because otherwise its integral over E is not defined since it is not in L+(E). It may be measurable and also nonnegative ae but I don’t see why it has to be nonnegative on all of E.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Thanks sir

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Can someone explain the difference between two approaches of solving the least square problem 1) using Transpose(A)*A*x = Transpose(A) * b,  or 2) Using QR decomposition, i.e. R * A = Transpose(Q) * b

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
thank you a lot for such a great explanation

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the professor showing on 1:28 when he's asking the students - "physics, ha ?" ))

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What an unusual way to say secant

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I can't breathe normally while listening to his lecture :)
 Anyway Prof. John Tsitsiklis has really helped me clear those important concepts.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
how can we relate raws in calculating the dimension of the column space

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
my lecturer is so smart he thought us all these 35 lectures in one lecture am i the only one who knows such Jenious

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thank You, Prof Strang.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Both Questions at  25:25 were pretty stupid. They asked for solution of algebraic technics in Calculus Class.

### 3. Independence
Professor, I bow to u. May be someday i will be this deft a teacher in what I do. Thank you

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Great lecture!
13:22 and then on paper: "P(A | B) undefined if P(B) = 0"
But what if B contains two points and A contains one of them?
P(B) = P(A) = 0, but I would like to say that P(A | B) = 1/2
What do you think about it?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
life saver

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Εξαιρετικη δουλεια Κε Τσιτσικλη.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
34:00 If rank(A) = 3, then U*x = 0 has only trivial solution. But A*(-1, -1, 1)^T = 0. So rank(A) is not equal to 3.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really hate to see any rewriting over partially cleaned blackboard, but our professor seems not to care

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Thus authors of such texts VIOLATE their OWN rules in the early chapters of the text.  I understand why they do so, but they almost always do so somewhat high-handedly, with NO EXPLANATION of the pedagogical philosophy behind their ABUSE OF NOTATION.  Instructors who use this abused notation in class seem to be surprised that some students get confused by it.  These students are in some cases exactly the students who are being most attentive to detail, which is a necessary mathematical skill.  

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I just wanted to say to those of you who don't want to blindly accept this determinant malarky, get Serge Lang's Intro to Linear Algebra & do the First Chapter - focusing on the dot product especially! then you can rederive the cross product by using the dot product & ignore all of the nonsense like 
i x j = k
j x i = - k
with no motivation.

Do the Lang chapter then 

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 18.07 why is d/dx b^x = d/dx f(kx) = k f'(kx) ? Thanks

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Thank you. I'm not very good at math.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
40:41 why is that 7 and not -7?? did he flip the signs for both numbers on the first row of the inverse matrix?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Can someone please explain how did he get 100^2 and not 100 x 2 (multiply+substract) operations at 33:22?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
"Ok, so let's talk about geometry, that should calm you down"

Lmao

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
5:10 There is a town in Finland and quite near Helsinki which swedish name is Alberga and we finn mathematicians always call is Algebra.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
This is also a very nice video on fisher information https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pneluWj-U-o more intuitive but also quite interesting!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is lecture 8....

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah but they are not horizontal, as in f'=0.

Ok let's move to space😂

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What the heck is wrong with this class. Are they even MIT students

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I just think, "Why aren't they clapping?"

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I always took the power rule for granted, but that was a mistake

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
i am in love with gilbert <3
student of Electrical Engineering finding his lectures THE BEST!

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Too close. Moves too frequently.

This man knows to make discussion about probability fun!

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Denis rules. Top class.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
34:33 dat dramatic close-up though xD

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
SUPER LOGIC

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My head was hurting in class just a few minutes ago. I couldn't get it and some one was saying "Oh easy so easy:" Why couldn't I see it? Then I search the topic. This video is the best! I kept thinking that my prof didn't explain anything! Or maybe I need something like this.Thanks for the easy to understand explanation. You just made my day, May Allah bless the person filming the video and MIT. Thanks. You just saved me. I thought I might fail the exam. Thanks a lot!!!

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I couldn't watch this past 30:43. The ginormous spider on the blackboard I found very scary.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
8:10 Did he say "probability for astrologists"? I guess it was a joke the audience did not get?

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
A country that makes scientific knowledge public will always always be an oasis and an example to be followed.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
When I first started engineering school I had a great math professor. He would come completely unglued if u ever said "minus 3", it is "negative 3".

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Never knew all these things are connected so beautifully ! Thanks prof. 🙏

### 34. Final Course Review
Et voila, Done.
First course which I completed.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Why does C need to be invertible here @30:45 ? For (CD)x=0, if Dx=0 (ie null space of D) automatically CDx=0 as well.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
this is pure gold

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Feels like 3b1b's video was inspired by this lecture!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I have a trivial doubt,  23:38 professor says x1 = (b1.c11)/detA
But won't x1 = b1.(c11 + c21 + c31 +.....cn1)/detA by definition transpose(C) b = x.detA

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
sorry shoudk read

10x -1x = 9.999999... -.999999999
9x = 9

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
For those of us who are newcomers in ML, it's most enlightening to know that unlike "pure optimization" that aims to find the most exact minimum possible, ML aims instead to be "close enough" to the minimum in order to train the ML engine, if you get " too close" to the minimum an over-fit  of your training data might occur. Thank you so much for the clarification

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No it's kind of a review of high school calculus and few things are added to it. It's essentially calculus 1. 

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great course!

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
21:00 I don´t understand that graphic. Is the graphic of a joint distribution? So, why the prof says that the distribution of the two random variables is a square? Does the function fx,y=1 has a height in the "Z" axis whose volume integrals to one?... HELP, PLEASE!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If a point is the intersection of two lines, and a line is the intersection of two planes, then is a plane the intersection of two 3-dimensional spaces?  That doesn't make any sense, but it almost seems like it would be true if you kept following the initial logic.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is prof name ? i see that he have more information about this chapiter or calculus in general ?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
When I was young I studied these topics at high school and again at the first year of the degree in physics 16 years ago. Now I’m rather surprised in be interested and in spending time to watch these valuable lectures on linear algebra, above all because I have nothing to do with them in my current life. But concepts are here so clearly explained that they turn me on the pleasure to remember how I was, that time puzzled, and how you can catch up comprehension of things after so many years.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
how can I like a video twice?

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Great class! Ty MIT for open education!

### Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function
MIT is the GOAT

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
*pulls into the garage

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is it called "integral"? what does this word mean literally?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
How could R be raised to a decimal number?

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha the second derivative test is just the determinant for a 2x2 hessian matrix, linear algebra FTW

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
39:38

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow... So I learned these stuff in 2nd grade of high school...so Harvard, here I come!

### Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators
Timestamps and Summary of Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators

0:00 - Review of Banach Spaces 
In the previous lecture, we started with vector spaces (algebraic structures defined over a field, closed by operations of addition & scaling). We examined normed vector spaces, i.e. those with a notion of "size". Norms naturally give rise to metrics, furnishing an analytic context. Those normed vector spaces that are complete (every Cauchy sequence converges) with respect to the metric induced by their norm, are called Banach spaces -- central objects of study in functional analysis.

1:13 - Summability: 
Definition: A series is summable if its sequence of partial sums converges. It is absolutely summable if the series of its norms (nonnegative numbers) converges, which is stronger than regular summability. Useful theorem: a space is Banach if and only if the converse holds. 

19:05 - Operators and Linear Functionals. 
Linear operators (or linear maps) between vector spaces are described here as the analog of matrices; there is a correspondence between linear maps of finite-dimensional vector spaces and matrices that represent these transformations on a given basis. Functionals are linear operators from a vector space to its base field.

19:56 - Example of a Linear Operator: 
Consider a continuous map from the unit square to the complex numbers that takes in a function in C([0, 1]) and "convolves it" by integrating its product with the aforementioned map over the compact interval [0, 1]. This is linear by the usual properties of integration. 

23:16 - Linear operators in full generality from V -> W. 
A linear operator between two vector spaces satisfies additivity and scalar homogeneity. As algebraic structures, vector spaces are essentially characterized by their closure under addition and scalar multiplication from a base field. The carrying-over of these properties from V to W indicates that linear operators are the "correct" structure-preserving maps to study between vector spaces (abstractly, K-linear maps are the morphisms in the category of vector spaces over K). 

26:30 - Continuous Linear Operators
We describe a linear operator as continuous if it preserves convergent sequences. Equivalently, we can formulate continuity in a topological manner: inverse images of open sets under continuous maps remain open. This is important to distinguish in the infinite-dimensional case -- all norms on finite-dimensional vector spaces are equivalent, hence all operators between f.d. spaces are continuous, but this need not hold for Banach spaces (as we've seen, spaces like C([0, 1]) are infinite-dimensional). Unlike general or f.d. vector spaces, Banach spaces express nontrivial analytic information: to study them appropriately, we must restrict to a suitable class of continuous linear maps that do convey this data. 

30:06 - Continuity and Boundedness
Theorem: a linear operator between normed vector spaces is continuous if and only if it is bounded. Informally, knowing that an operator between normed vector spaces "maps arbitrarily close points to arbitrarily close points" tells us the same information that it "maps bounded subsets to bounded subsets". It turns out that it's enough to show this criterion for continuity at a single point, e.g., the zero vector.  

44:10 -  Example of a Bounded Operator
Interpreting the earlier example as a continuous linear operator from C([0, 1]) -> C([0, 1]), it is clearly continuous when acting on continuous functions. Regarding it as a map between normed vector spaces (in fact, Banach spaces) allows us to view it as a bounded operator, specifically under the supremum norm as discussed in the prior lecture. 

49:30 - The Space B(V, W) 
Given two normed vector spaces V and W, we define B(V, W) to consist of all bounded (eq. continuous) linear functionals V -> W. Define on it the operator norm, which returns the maximal norm of a vector in the image of a given bounded linear operator; by linearity we don't lose any information by normalizing & considering the supremum over the images of just unit vectors. This is checked to satisfy the norm axioms, turning B(V, W) into a normed vector space in its own right. 

58:44 - If W is Banach, so is B(V, W) 
Strengthening the previous observation that B(V, W) is a normed vector space, if we assume that W is Banach (V need only be an NVS) then B(V, W) itself becomes a Banach space. Completeness follows from the initial lemma that a space is Banach when a series is absolutely summable if and only if it is summable. 

1:21:08 - The (Continuous) Dual Space
For any normed vector space V, define its continuous/topological dual space V' to consist of all bounded linear functionals from V to its base field K. (i.e. B(V, K) with the above notation). These are always Banach - for the l^p sequence spaces, examples include (l^1)' = l^∞, but (l^∞)' is not l^1 (not symmetric!). In general (l^p)' = l^q, where 1/p + 1/q = 1 (conjugate exponents); l^2 is special since it is self-dual. Note: for finite-dimensional vector spaces, V' coincides with the usual (algebraic) dual space of all linear functionals V -> K because continuity is immediate. However, it is strictly a subspace of the algebraic dual in infinite dimension, since one can always construct discontinuous linear functionals on infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

I love it when math gets graphic.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
compared to 18.06 these lectures demand much more involvement of the viewer in terms of pausing and thinking about things which professor Strang is saying and once you start doing that this course would feel if not more but as beautiful as than 18.065.
Someone coming from 18.06 might feel a bit unhappy but trust me this is amazing just keep going.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks so much from Thailand. I have learned a lot from you.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 18:20, shouldn't it be   d/dx b^x = k * M (2^k)  at x=0?
If I apply the chain rule,    d/dx 2^kx  =  k * 2^kx * M (2^k)

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well, that's the definition of critical point. If the rate of change wasn't zero, it'd mean the function would still change there. In extreme points, the function stops changind (increasing or decreasing), so the rate of change is 0.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
k = 1 / M(2) ; for b = e => b = 2^k => e = 2 ^ 1/M(2); for b = e and k = 1/M(2) => ln (e) = ln (2 ^ 1/ M(2)) => 1 = 1/M(2) x ln (2)
 => ----------------------------------------------------------------------------M(2) = ln (2) or M(a) = ln (a)------------------------------------------------------------------------------

d (2^x)/ dx = 2^x . M(2) => 2^x . ln(2) ; for any x.

In general rule: d (a^x)/ dx = a^x . M(a) => a^x . ln(a)

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Hmm.. as of 13/06/2015, This lecture has about 36E3 views; while lecture 1 has about 1.46E6 views. This assuming those that watch the quiz reviews are serious learners. Then you guys are about 2.5% (36E3/1.46E6). Congratulations, you guys are the course elite. (Of course life isn't a zero sum game so it doesn't matter elite or not). However A+ on self discipline.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT and Prof. Jerison!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't know if there is already a comment on this, but I think there is a mistake in 34:24, because the derivative of tag^-1(x) is the derivative of cot x, that's to say, cosec^2(x), not 1 + x^2, that is the derivative of arctag x

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
37:44 ... *I think he's done something wrong but I'm not going to say anything until 38:55* :P

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
never seen liner equations ever and I am 15 and this guy explains it so perfectly

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
Question: If A is poorly conditioned, I thought QR decomposition was computationally unstable as well.  Why would we do this with a poorly conditioned matrix?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
The probability is the probability of DETECTION not existence or state, the measurement problem is that we can only measure in one dimension of space and one of time in any quantised single act of measurement and the wave function NEVER collapses, it is always converted from distribution in time (wavelength) to distribution in space and vice versa. I have solved everything but as always people given accolades for incorrect ideas find it hard facing the truth that reverses those accolades. The Theory of Everything has been completed.

Must have missed something here. In one quadrant of a circle of radius 1 we get an area of pi/8. That would give the area of the circle to be pi/2?

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Thanks MIT, winning hearts and minds.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
This lecture is amazing. Pro.Strang gives an intuitive perspective Fourier Series, and how it is related to orthogonal vector. I know Fourier transform pretty well but now have a deep understanding of that.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Outstanding Gill!  I studied LA 40 years ago, but it was a mere 2 dimensional projection of the many dimensions you present.  I bought your book and donated all my other LA texts.  You're an excellent instructor.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME] No. He's trying to write the second order differential equation as a system of first order linear equations, or basically you are just substituting y'=some variable, basically just manipulating the expressions so the 2nd order equation is "transformed" into equations of first order. The matirx of coeffiecients represents the coefficients of the "transformed" resulting system of 1ST order linear equations. It is the same idea as substitution in quadratic equations like ax^4+bx^2+c, and

### 3. Independence
Awesome, thanks a lot for this wonderful lesson 💗

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Super poor photographer, this is not a movie, please leave the camera to the blackboard, students need time to digest, instead of continuing to give the teacher close-up. The teacher worked hard and the whole course was broken by the photographer.

him: "Which part?"
me: "All of it"
him: "MIT OCW...Okay, so next..."

Wow, people have to take lectures for this? How stupid are you?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think after he went through the elimination process he should have summarized the rules of row operations (the algorithm) for programming purposes. Of course, in numerical analysis courses later, identifying the most efficient algorithm is a major task.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder where is Lecture 8......

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]In 3D, you need z-axis. The slices could not work without a 3D visualization. In my understanding, that's why he used the z-axis... which is the vertical when you talk 3D.

### 3. Parametric Inference

stretching HAHAHH

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
When we get linear equations, Ax=b, where A is an n  x n matrix, and x and b are column vectors with n components, we can see b as the linear combination of column vectors of A and components of x is equals to b. That is,

column 1 of A * 1st component of x 
+ column 2 of A * 2nd component of x ... 
+ column n of A * nth component of x. 

This view is new for me. Thank you, Prof. Strang.

if you are a random person like i am, which has nothing to do with anything of the information given in this video, like i am (i am a chef in a restaurant) you think to yourself, WTF IS HE TALKING ABOUT!!? and i watched this 10 fucking minutes ....

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Without the need of guessing, I use the cross product method and then I equate like-terms to like-coefficients followed by solving the very simple simultaneous equation - that is for coefficients of x^1,  (A + B) = 4 eqn(1) and for coefficients of x^0; (2A - B) = -1 eqn(2), therefore B = 4 - A by eqn (1), sub into eqn (2) to get A = 1 and hence B = 4 -1 = 3, Q.E.D.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
With his lecture, I could sit in my desk all day and study. Math is so great.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Expecting to see Dr. Strang lecturing at age 106.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
jan 11? so did you approve?

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
I'm a math major, and my uni only offers theoretical CS as a unit to CS majors (or you'd have to do enough to earn a CS minor at least), which sucks because this really interests me, but I don't care much for the engineering/code-monkey stuff. Thanks for uploading this, I'm gonna follow these closely for sure!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i not understand - but it So hard.. i'll learen it soon :P~ lol

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yeah i got how X - Xo became zero but i don't get how the term multiplied with X - Xo became f'(x)

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
anyone know where i can get solutions for this course on the mit ocw website?

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
All these videos previously had a delay between the audio and video. These are reuploads, and that's why there's so few views

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
public school cannot effort teacher like that. his salary is probably more then high school teacher lol. 

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Why is Prof. Strang so successful at teaching? It's not just that his explanations are clear and reasonable. His personal style has a lot to do with it. He comes across as unpretentious and as someone who is doing this journey with you.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
I think this lecture is a nice sip of randomized linear algebra for fresh people like me, but the notations are confusing (a lot of sum w/o specifying which variable to sum over) and I think the bit at 28:50 is incorrect (is professor confusing estimator of AB and the expectation of the estimator?). But the high level goal is clear, which is nice. I did some search online and I think the lecture notes at https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04481 are helpful.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Actually better than his textbook :)

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Cheaters on quiz!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
he gives you the right vision of mathematical concepts. and that's important for problem solving.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This lesson is so great! Thank you so much!!!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This with the theory of relativity is moonshine..IIS has a clock and has been circling it for more than 10 years. No one has yet reported that cosmonauts have another time.
If you transmit one frequency f1 with an apparatus that has speed v, then that frequency will change to f2. That is a fact and the rest is Zionism.
If you want the receiver to receive f1 then you have to change f1 to the appropriate frequency.

Not necessarily.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
i will tell you why u understand everthing here..This professor is great and the other thing is..This lecture wont be explained in 10 minutes like here in Germany. Of course u understand fucking nothing if you explain such important things in 10 minutes and then begin with new stuff.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there any prerequisite required?

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At the end, the area is given in terms of the angle theta. I'm assuming this is in radians. Three questions:

1) What units is the solution in? Meters^2?
2) I assume you cannot simply change between radians and degrees, as that would cause the calculated area to be off by a factor of 180/pi?
3) If that is true, why not? What is special about radians that makes the solution specific to radians?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
охуеноооо!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Oh geez. What happened to the MIT student body? Universities are just politically correct money making evolutionarily illogical units subject to corruption at this point

Brilliant teacher. A person who can impart love for the subject he teaches

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I have just try the quiz on the mit ocw. Before doing the quiz I supposed it was an easy course. Now I think I was wrong: although the calculation is simple, and the problem are not difficult, one needs to be very clear about the basic concepts taught in the lectures.

The quiz: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/ax-b-and-the-four-subspaces/exam-1/MIT18_06SCF11_ex1.pdf

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Clear and straight to the point!!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lmao the students, man. What part of 'I know this can be done without calculus but it's just to illustrate the general method' do they not understand? That girl at around 19 minutes into the video doesn't get the point

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Shouldn't the five be a negative 5...?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
From where you people practice? Professor Strang's book?

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
9:24 so glad for this clarification, was confusing me while reading a different textbook that didn't quite cover that detail. P(X = x) huh?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
First video series ive watched without getting bored (as for educative videos), this teacher rocks, all hail Mr. old genius guy. Perfectly understandable, my respect to him.

Anyone else see a face in the brackets at 30:22?

### 34. Final Course Review
I finished this lecture on Sep. 16, 2022, at 22:35pm. Thank you Prof. Strang, the last month (Aug. 7 - Sep. 16) was so wonderful, memorable.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you Universe for sending this happy man to the Earth.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Nice lecture, but you should also add the lecture contents in the description so that people don't have to go through the entire lecture to find out whether it's relevant to their course or not.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
what is Convext? like that ....hahah

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
May God bless you, Professor Strang !

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
16:02 is it in N(A-I) instead of N(A)?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Beautifully delivered lectures. The content is well structured and easy to review.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Vary good

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
26:10

I have a question about the cost of elimination.
Ax=b

For an nxn matrix A
For the 1st pivot, instead of 100^2, shouldn’t it cost 100*99?
2nd pivot, instead of 99^2, shouldn’t it cost 99*98?
3rd pivot, instead of 98^2, shouldn’t it cost 98*87?

So, instead of n^2+(n-1)^2+(n-2)^2+...., shouldn’t it be n(n-1)+(n-1)(n-2)+(n-2)(n-3)+.... instead?


Also, how did he get n^2 for the matrix b?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
For the subspace in r4 with all the components of a vector adding up to zero, how is that a subspace? What if I had the vector with components [-4,-6,7,3], those add up to zero but if I were to add up any member than this wouldn't be a subspace.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
People who received this professor's lecture are bloody luck. These concepts and ideas were thrown in front of many high school, IB and undergrad students including me and they were expected to make sense out of them just by formula sheets and example questions. It is nice to see conceptual and even intuitive explanation of them.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
What a fantastic professor :) :)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I can't buy the book, how much will I miss due to that??

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Can anyone explain further why appending the 1s to the triangle matrix at the end shifts the triangle back to the origin? Also, if possible a little elaboration on why the cofactors columns equal 0 when multiplied by a different row number fro it's column number?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
It's ironic how they still use chalkboards.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Why does my university not allow for students to record the lectures? It is so good to have those at home in video format. You can re-watch them and rewind time anytime you missed something because you weren't paying attention. Mighty helpful.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:40 what kind of coser is that?

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
About calculating the power of a test (1:13:00 ->), isn't the most conservative choice for theta 3.49? I mean, when the true theta equals 3.49, the power becomes 5 % (with 5 % significance level). This is because the sampling distributions of Xn_bar (standardized) under theta_0 (3.5) and theta_1 (3.49) are basically equal.

Using this logic, the power of a test would always be equal to the significance level. Obviously, there's a flaw in my logic, but where? Prof. Rigollet says that we should look at the worst possible case (1:13:28). In my humble opinion, the worst possible case is when the difference between theta_0 and theta_1 is miniscule.

EDIT:

Ok, so Prof. Rigollet basically answers my question in the next lecture (8. at 13.45 ->). If theta_1 is defined on a set Theta_1, then the power is the value where it is minimized within this set. What I didn't get at first, or got overly confused about, is that in real life I choose my theta_1 basically as my best guess. This way, in general it won't always be equal to the significance level. If I let theta_1 be such that it can be the 'next door neighbor' to my theta_0, then the power will be equal to the significance level.

Thank you.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
BEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Isnt there a mistake @ 46:24 ? Shouldn’t the position 8,1 of matrix A contain a8,1 and not a1,8? Same for position 8,2, shouldn’t it contain a8,2 instead of a2,8? And same for position 1,2? Great lecture thanks!

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Υο.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
The number of positive pivots may not equal the number of positive eigenvalues. Take the matrix [1,0;-1,0] for example: without row exchange ,it reduces to [1,0;0,0], but with row exchange it reduces to [-1,0;0,0]. Odd number of row exchanges will change the sign of determinant and therefore change the number of negative eigenvalues. Assume that there is no row exchange and no multiplication of a row by a (negative) scalar, then the result holds.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm looking to learn calculus and coming to the end of this video, it seems I'm missing lots of information.
What previous math categories should I learn to continue on with calculus?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So what if he forgot it? My teacher forgets a lot of formulae, he's still a beast at integrating though.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Thank you so much, best explanations and always interesting to follow

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A

I have a question about the last integral. About that last part. Can we manipulate the answer by log rules i.e. subtract ln2 from the answer as it's a constant and then write a new constant?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
In the last bit, there lies the fact the alternating group A_n could be viewed as being a normal subgroup of index 2 in the corresponding permutation group S_n. Algebra is a fun topic.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I dont understand why the cost is n^2 to make zero first column. A single operationg is multiplication and subtraction ,therefore i need to multiply first row with some constant and substract it from 2nd to get zero. It takes 1 operation to make (21) zero so 99 or 100 operation in total to make first column zero except pivot. Help me out here please

thanks! great lecture!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Fantastic Lecture. Loved it..  Thanks a lot :)

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I'm not sure, if (1,1,2) (2,2,5) (3,3,8) are independent.
I mean, if we ignore the third component, (1,1) (2,2) and (3,3) are obviously NOT independent. They lie on the same line.
Now when we add the third component, the only thing that changes, is the Z-coordinate.
Those 3 vectors span a 2-Dimensional subspace in R^3 through (1,1), and are thus dependent.

It would be really good if this video series were continued...

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much MIT !!! I love all of your videos. However, I was really confused by all of the completing the square stuff and complicated inequalities and the like. After doing a bit of thinking, I realized there is no need to do all of that. You can simply look at the cross sections in the x and y directions respectively at the critical point and see if they are min or maxes. If they are both min, then its a min, if both max its a max, if one max and one min, then its a saddle. Lots of love for you, xxxx.

Holy ****. The algebra explanation is so much more undersandable for me than the geometric one.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
is this a lecture for idiots or what? for the past two lectures he said like one or two major points and he is just keep repeating them...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Matrix multiplication by four methods:
1. Cij: (ith row of A).(jth column of B)
2. Columns of C are a combination of columns  A. The columns of B tell how they are linearly combined.
3. Rows of C are a combination rows of B. The rows of A tell how they are linearly combined.
4. Sum of [(column of A).(row of B)]

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lovely bit of explanation at 24:19. A great teacher.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thanks for making probability easy  for us...u r really a good teacher.
..no doubt.

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
these exam problems he's going over are so easy

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Why do all the videos start from the middle of the lecture, rather than the beginning? Can this please be fixed somehow? :( It starts off the bat & we spend like 15 mins trying to understand what the professor is discussing.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
21:19 When your sneaky single-variable calculus prof sneakily does a multivariable calculus problem.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
any to recommend me?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I nod my head to the screen like listening to rock music, while I am not.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Strang is so funny

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
"Biased" is the word that u were looking for :)

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
His lectures are in an endless loop. He comes back to the statements that he has said earlier in the lecture.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Oh cool. I've never computer the nullspace of the row space before. Initially, I thought of computer the nullspace of the columnspace of the transpose, but the method he provides - calculating E - is so easy, once you've already done all the work computing the other subspaces.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Did we ever prove that if the set of eigenvalues are distinct, the set of eigenvectors are linearly independent? I ask because at ~ 32:00 taking u_o = c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + cn*xn requires the eigenvectors to form a basis for an n-dimensional vector space (i.e. span the column space of an invertible matrix). It feels right but I have no solid background for how to think about it

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was trying to understand this for 3 years , THANK YOU PROFESSOR !

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Second-rate universities: Buys the most expensive hi-tech educational tools to provide "high" quality learning.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Professor Strang thank you for another well plan lecture on Structure of Neural Nets for Deep and Machine Learning. Learning is a life long process.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lecture was SOOOOOOO well done. Bravo.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
38:02

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I'm still confused about independent vectors. how is [112],[225] independent? 
2(1)-2 =0. So, we do get a 0 using some linear combination, right?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
After viewing the 3blue1brown video on Duality, I am just seeing xT*A*x as the results of applying a linear transformation to a vector x and then projecting that new vector back onto x; if the vectors still point "in the same direction" i.e. the projection is positive, then A is positive definite

### Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!
Isn't the "convolution" covered in this lecture actually correlation? Real convolution involves a reflection across the y-axis right? So the numbers would be inverted first, then multiplied. As seen here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
lol, that is so true

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
37:56 can use the wallis formula

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
This is very cryptic, especially without the first part.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I connected the properties of a determinant (1-7) to the volume of a box. 
Now, can anyone please explain the connection of properties 8,9,10 to the volume of the box?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Thanks for your amazing course, professor Gilbert Strang! I really enjoy it.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
36:02

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
*Note:  Lecture 8 is Exam 1, so no video was recorded. View the complete course at: http://ocw.mit.edu/18-01F06.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India
http://www.wellesleypublishers.com/buy.html

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Why is the intersection of null space and row space, only the zero vector? Why can it not be a vector such that V times Vtranspose is 0?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Thank you very much, sir. I am watching lectures and enjoying them. I have benefited from you because we do not have a teacher  in Yemen because of the war situation, so you became my teacher

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
absolutely a brilliant example for how to apply eigenvalues to real world problem

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I wish my college tutor could watch this. So he won't fuck any more young brains.

Maybe this helps someone: https://notebooks.azure.com/menziess/libraries/Python-Linear-Algebra

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very good, I am refreshing up all

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
great course...was waiting for it for a long time!! :)

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love Taylor expansions too, but It's really got a dreadful derivation. If I really want to get it, I am going to have to delete my facebook account, youtube account, sell my laptop and everything else I have except study tools and lock myself up with a month's supply bread and butter and isolate myself from everyone for a whole month's break if I am going to master this understanding. Doesn't seem realistic for many of us, but,idk, I might try it. Otherwise, mastery will take a verylong time. 

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks prof jerison and prof muller!
i found these lectures 10 years too late but thank you for giving me the much needed sense of purpose during this self-isolation period.

just finished 18.01 final exam. 
off to 18.02!!!

so much humility and grace that he is working so hard even in his mid-80s... May God continue to bless you and your family.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why is that

 dw/dx=2ax+by

and 

d²w/dxdy=b

and not

d²w/dxdy=2a+b

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I didn't quite understand the area of the triangle to 1/2 question yet. Can someone please explain how it is so?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am an asian and i completely lost at 5 minutes at the end of lecture

and wtf you guys at MIT get tutors if you need help and by the sounds of it there are more than one?! jezz were lucky to get 1 tutorial a week with 1 assignment a week and 3 lectures a week per math module lol thats the max for a math module and its a lot more difficult :(

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Like if you spotted that error in lec 9 itself and were wondering for hours about it

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
that cameraman job tho

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Dear Gilbert Strang!! I wish to kiss your hands, your sacred hands as you are my Guru of Matrix Algebra. You explain so well. your way of teaching is miraculous.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I had an incredibly difficult professor, Alex Freire at University of Tennessee, and your material helped me a ton back then. With the bar that guy set I learned a TON that semester. Thanks for your help in getting me through that class.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
What a wonderful teacher.  Thanks a bunch.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
31 years old curse is quite interesting.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
wtf this fella just said see ya next monday after thanksgiving and it is actually this weekend for me o.O

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
wow, this professor just get rid of all my confusions about the formula of Gram-Schmidt

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I graduated in IT and Computer science a few years ago, and now when I see MIT courses online I am really impressed with the quality of it.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
single integral - area
double integral - volume

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
this is awesome.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
An awesome lecture indeed! Studied elementary differential equations at University 40 years ago. About two weeks of lectures to present the same materail. Linear algebra clarifies the process very well. The  information relayed here conveys the cumulative effort of my lifetime  study and concentration..as a hobby....yet some students will soak this up  in minutes...work problems for a couple of weeks and have it down.....Awesome!!!!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Blessing for mathematicians

### 25. Classical Inference III
Thanks Prof.Tsitsiklis for the amazing course.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So, Inflection points are not necessarily critical points. Am I right?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My classmate and I independent studied Calc BC...we were told to learn trig substitutions, spent 2-3 weeks on them, then found out they weren't on the AP exam -.- *sigh* trig substitutions screws everyone over.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow, this is the most basic in my country for secondary schools! we did this in Cambridge's o'levels examination a month ago.....

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
30:25 , It only means they are uncorrelated rather than independent.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
God damn he must have showed how to compute determinant atleast 7 times... But he actually answers questions. That's quite good for a prof

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecturer with good handwriting!

### 3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph
I feel so sad. I feel like tat I almost touch my bound.

Thank you, Prof. Gilbert Strang and MIT.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
v=vot + 1/2at^2

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Astonishing lecture... !

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
@[USERNAME]. How does the professor conclude that variance is 1 if the random variable is divided by standard deviation?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Lec 1".... this is the first lecture,﻿ which of course covers the basics. go deeper.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Yip...true that but, when it comes to maths, science and technology MIT is best, the website is web.mit.edu

### 4. Counting
what a nice proof at 35.27!  we had to proof it algebraically in analysis 1 for EECS, took me and my friends about 5 hours haha. this way its a lot more intuitive - what a great lecturer he is. Thanks!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I really enjoy learning in his pace.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 17:10 what a noob that child is

### Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras
This mainly about definitions and the intricacies of proving what seems to be obvious but is not. Extremely fine attack.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Were all the following spam responses generated by some MIT genius? 

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
my uni should just play this video in class tbh

### 18. Properties of Determinants
This works for me. Thanks 

### 34. Final Course Review
Huge thanks to Prof Strang and MIT!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
haha XD
laughed my ass off till the end :p

### 8. Undecidability
Professor laughed 2 times. First time when a student said Cantor went crazy and second time when a student wrote cannabalism for feeding TM into TM

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lecture is pretty insane.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
omg I can't believe how people like this course... he is so random & disorganized and pretty much talks his thoughts out. it's hard to follow the logic... some important concepts were covered too fast and non-important talks were so abundant ...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
ok i still need to ,land my missile on that asteroid you have not yet seen but hurry we must perfect all math to run scenarios so exciting ,no detail is unimportant , the hardwire the final chip to the launchpad mbefore t=0

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Was the Law of Cosines originally derived from the vector proof he showed, or was the vector proof [a dot b = ||a||*||b||*cos(angle)] derived from the Law of Cosines?
Or were they both derived from something else [originally]?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I love you, professor. it's so important that you're doing this.  it's an absolutely right thing to do. I remember completely different professors and completely corrupted faculty in Russia.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
thanks professor Strang, you don't know how helpful this is for many of us!

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
students are dumb in his class.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
We never could know what we learn in YouTube or Bilibili. Thanks MIT , Peking University and other universities those could really bring knowledge to me.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't know why but I feel kinda sad knowing that this course is over.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Has this video been remastered with AI techniques?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This saved my life

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
A is singular -> eigenvectors are in null space.

31:43A에 I를 더해도 eigen vector은 그대로

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for sharing these wounder class.
However it really drove me mad, cause the Professor doesn't clean the blackboard very well.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thank you, MIT. I hope this can help out clarify some parts, i.e., the norm of magnitude space and the linear independent space, that I sometimes confuse at. As long as I can clearly understand the context about definitions well, I can correct what I mistake at. God bless you always.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Isn't AP Calculus equivalent to this course?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
What is the text book of this course?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
https://youtu.be/or6C4yBk_SY  : "Orthogonal matrices are the queens, and symmetric matrices are the kings.. "

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Matrix x

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I couldn't find the rest of the course. Where can I find the rest of the course?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
The dot product of orthogonal vectors equals zero. All of a sudden it clicked when I remembered my conclusion as to what a dot product actually was, that is, "what amount of one vector goes in the direction of another." Basically, if vectors are orthogonal, then no amount of one will go in the direction of the other. Like how a tree casts no shadow at noon.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just binged 11 of these lectures in one day... should I rethink my life choices?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why there are no students sit there?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Took me some time but the whole Ascrewedup example is really neat for seeing why the off diagonals are 0

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Lecture 29: Partial fractions

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
You have to love MIT! Thank you! :)

### 34. Final Course Review
Today I finished this course with respect to Linear Algebra. Although I had finished a linear algebra course in my university, frankly I realized that what I knew about matrix and four subspaces are not sufficient (and some of them are wrong). I really appreciate to professor Strang for his amazing lecture, not only concentrated on the algebric aspect, but also the "matrix" facet and the applications. I really enjoyed this lecture, and I will recommend this course to my friends who wants to learn about linear algebra. Thank you So MUCH!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
It is high time that all your theories on magnetism,electrical energy conversions theories and superconductive theories have to be reevaluated as we are being watched by Alien Flying Saucers and there is a possibiity that we may be controlled by them in future.
Refer Cheiro's Book on "World Predictions "

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
man that was tragic...

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
35:17

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
"we only live so long, we just skip that proof" -- Prof. Strang 2009 
(and I low-key wish this was the case for all math tests )

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:58 نقطة مهمة جاد بالنسبة لي

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
why is A-lamda I singular at 19:00?

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
Why joint density was not divided by f(x) to get posterior probability?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Alongside this course, check out this too..           https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21BCE50ABFF029F1            This is a homework help content by MIT TAs for this course...     its really helpful.....

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Loved the part when he said 'OK'

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
why we always consider a level surface to prove that gradient is perpendicular to tangent vector to the surface...  what if the particle moves on a surface which doesn't has a  constant value throughout  its domain of definition

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
“I won, but it didn’t pay off!”  😂

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
How come at 12:44 the sum of S and U is all 3×3 matrices?

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Google says France, yes.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you very much for these videos! these approximations make so much sense, it's like the sine wave is locally a quadratic curve at the crests and trough. what a light bulb moment for me!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
After you derive the product rule, you can easily prove the quotient rule by considering the derivative of the product f(x) * ( 1 / f(x) )

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
You have to stand for all the bad jokes 😂

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Please prove the facts.

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
wow, beautiful, now i see why it oscillates

### 3. Independence
at  37:15 ,why P(A∩B∩C)=1/4 isnt supposed to be 1/8 as each one of event have a probability of 1/2

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Without that lecture gallery and blackboards, it doesn't feel like MIT.

### 34. Final Course Review
What a great set of lectures, thanks for putting these up.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
humans will start machine learning here

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
think of in linear equations: 4y+z-2(2y-2z) = 2-(6x2)  but that doesn't mean you have to change the original equation 2y-2z = 6  to  4y-4z = 12 because it's the same thing.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a boss. 

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Lecture 26 is Professor Strang’s best performance so far.

In lecture 25, in front of students, he screwed up his proof showing real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues.  Got confused and had to refer to his notes.  In this lecture, in front of no students, he gives a tour de force performance.

Hope there no students in his remaining lectures, because his cyberspace audience is orders of magnitude larger than his MIT audience.


### 14. Poisson Process I
Prof John's lecture on Poissan PMF is available at: https://youtu.be/eTLa9GDID8A

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
It was an awesome video,
But does anyone think sir looks like Elon🧐?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I'm not drinking! I'm serious, do you remeber "your profile picture is a little dirty" the strange thing is that i founded across internet again! just by chance!! Do you want it cold or hot, the drink i mean?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is that a joke? If so, you're freaking funny.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Five Minutes of the "GRAPHS" is in lecture 11. Just follow lecture 11 from 39:30.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Wish you very best health Prof Strang, You're really good teacher

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
*Differential


### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
What's the difference between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Good lecture, but I think the geometric intepretation of SVD is its motivation. We should use SVD as  a tool to understand general linear transformation

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Does anyone know where the notes are?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Thanks, Dr. Strang

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really like the post-processing of video that enhance all those handwriting.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I didn't understand anything

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
am i the first to comment here？ thank you Gilbert Strang !!! i really love your courses

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love learning the proofs of ideas I took for granted or only intuited vaguely

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Excelente colega, bien explicado

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
excellent Teacher.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I LOVE THIS!


### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
this is blowing up my mind wtf is happening lolol

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Who the heck disliked this ....those foolish mortals

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Professor Strang is really enjoying teaching, I am so appreciate that I could learn from him! I like the way  he teaches so much!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Thanks for MIT OCW

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
They still use chalkboards?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I agree with you.. I mean I think he means the first one it makes sense better to me :/ 

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Nothing but love <3

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Good lecture, but I feel it only just starts getting into the heart of PCA before it ends. I don't see a continuation of the the discussion in subsequent lectures, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So I managed to make it through the first lesson. Now, you lost me.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
how could Bx = [1 0 1]' ??????????

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
im doing distance learning and this guy is saving my ass.
you cant imagine how hard is to learn calculus 2 from a book ! (or BAD book).

Its easier for me to hear this french talking in english than to read the book which is written in my mother tongue (spanish), so figure it out !

thanks dude !

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
수학이 여러가지 수학인데 결과가 다르게 나옵니다. 글로벌 뉴딜. 뉴딜의 결과를 뽑아보면 굉장히 나쁜 결과가 나올 겁니다.

### 14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility
Why do we say that for a NTM decider, all branches halt on all inputs?
By "branches halt" do we include the possibility of one of the branches having an accepting state and hence all the other branches halt when we find that accepting state? (Since if the NTM finds an accepting state it halts).

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Loved the lecture but when we assume that the weight is settled we balance the forces.
Balancing horizontal forces gives us Tcosa1=Tcosa2
Same T because we can't have tow tensions in one string or the string breaks.
Which gives angle a1=a2

### Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers
The breakdown of the decimal representation of Real numbers was genius. Thanks!

It also calls my attention that in a world-class University like MIT, lectures are still given in such a traditional fashion.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Hi, can anyone explain why 10:20 sigma_1 and sigma_2 greater than 0? Thanks!

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Got any Americans who know calculus?  Paul Revered

nice.

expecting a decision tomorrow :)

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

I love the motivation he gives for the problem.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Could anyone please help me with this? At about 15'30'', the professor says "vertically simple". Does he mean that the sides of  the solid is vertical (all equal to the height)? So the graph of the top is the same as the graph of the bottom? Thank you very much!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
For anyone confused by the block matrix explanation --- the I and F and blocks of zeros --- hang in there until lecture 8 where it all becomes clearer. And yes, F may be interspersed with the I, and, contrary to the top rated answer on Stack Exchange, this cannot be remedied with permutation matrices. Basically it's just a visual cue that allows you to pluck out the relevant numbers.

He is so precious. Bless his heart.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
C'est du niveau de lycee.. Interessant mais le niveau parait bien bas a l'entree..

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
Maths is strong. Problem with you is you follow some proven previous laws. Unless you break open those and see through...much gold is beyond. Live close to nature. It will teach you new maths, prodect and reality. Mit should travel with naturure for new definitions. I like it but.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
20:36 Great

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The thing I love about math, is that it is totally independent of the world. Although mathematics does have applicaitons in many aspects of reality, it doesnt necessarily say anything about it. So math in itself is really formless, and a playground for people to tinker around in. Where everyone can enjoy and express new ideas.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Definitely you!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Dude your awesome! haha i like learning maths this way idk why better than all teachers and coaches ive come across 
Tip for students learning maths online:
watch n learn all MIT-ocw  Maths lectures
watch n learn all khanacademy maths videos(there too many but still)

and ull be like king of mathematics lmao!


### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At 43:32, shouldn't Professor Strang have put *infinite* as opposed to *1* solutions to Ax = b. When r = m = n, all n (or m) - dimensional vectors can be obtained from linear combinations of A's columns because the column space is also n-dimensional.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are these really MIT math lecture? I think they are just some middle school math course. The teacher cannot go to any more details, but the students still have those stupid questions!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Amazing lecture! It will be better to learn this course with the textbook also by Strang. The videos provide big pictures and kind of whet your appetite for reading the book. The book gives detailed explanation and just satisfies your curiosity.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
great lecture .i am so grateful to prof.gilbert

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
One day Lord Kelvin asked his students: what is a mathematician? Then he wrote on the blackboard the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity of e^-x^2 and added: a mathematician is the one who writes next to this integral the square root of pi without even thinking about it!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank god you saved my life. Its mysterious how people could understand this kind of things without internet and youtube!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
But Again. When is the average person going to find this useful or use it in the real world themselves? Should I really waste days and days of my short life so I can learn how to help a truck driver calculate the traffic flow at certain times of day? Why should I be forced to learn this and if I don't,I cant graduate?

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A

Great guy, these materials are very informative and provide a great insight

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
it awesome. 
thank u prof

### 25. Classical Inference III
Completed this course. A great resource for anybody looking to gain a better understanding of probability and statistics. Professor Tsitsiklis is a great lecturer and thank you to him and MIT for bringing such a series to life.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
RFS Israel *

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really like that the instructors at MIT spend the time to write the topic on the board which reinforces the point of their discussion. And they all have good penmanship which allows the student to concentrate on what he is saying, not trying to interpret the writing. I also like they're using blackboards and chalk which show up nicely in the videos. When my school changed to whiteboards there were times when reflections obscured the writing and some of those markers had a distracting smell.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I believe in god now

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do you assume everyone taking multivariable calculus already took linear algebra? In example, I've learned single variable calculus on my own, now I'm learning this and although I've known what a matrix is for a long time I've never actually learned how to perform operations or them or how to use them. And linear algebra I'm going to take in university after holidays are over.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
In 41:23 he says that it's actually enough to look only at the terms of the form X to the k-th - why is it enough?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I"ve watched the 18.06 from lecture 1 to this section, suddently realized that all contents were in Prof. Strang's brain and he didn't utilize any auxiliary materials/tools to control the rhythm, so amazing... Thank you Sir for your great teaching!

34:00 but what if b = pi * i, it is wrong but that means, that i is less than 0 but why is it like that

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Determinant is the first chapter in some textbooks, which makes students lost in linear algebra.
Dr. Glibert made everything easy to understand, thank you!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
dont mind me but why is A^TA symmetriiiiiiic

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do you still use chalk and black boards in america?? We stopped using them in England when I was about 8 (i'm now 18). Seems a bit pre-historic. Has you're lecturer never heard of powerpoint? or even just a white board?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
@[USERNAME]   ...uni ?? I went over to Australia and that was the only place i've ever heard that term. Are you form Australia? Just wondering if Australia is the only one who has the term ' uni '. 

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
@[USERNAME]- looks like class rooms at MIT have ledges to jump off from if you don't understand anything :-)

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
The funny thing is, I'm also doing a general relativity series and got to covectors. I understand what they are computationally, but couldn't "visualize" them, beyond the typical "stacks". Then I stumbled on the interpretation of covectors as linear maps, which served as a connection to linear algebra. I tried so many things to built a geometric interpretation all night but nothing formed in my head properly, so I was like, "meh, I'm 80% done with Professor Strangs lectures, might as well do another one". He led with x^H*A*x > 0 and for some reason, everything just started to click (x^H*A is an implicit map, so I have ideas about how to analyze things in my other GR class). Funny how his lecture was what I needed to get my head turning again. Thank you, and awesome lecture! ☺️🙌🏽 Stay safe during #COVID19

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Anyone From MIT AOE?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
5 years of physics+4 years of phd in astrophysics and this man managed to give me a much clearer picture of algebra operations than what I got from all my professors.
Thank you so much for these lectures Proff. Strang!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh crap he just said what I just commented 

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you mit for your contribution. The thing that makes you better than harvard and princeton is that you allow other people who can't afford tuition to learn nearly as good as you students. That's what makes you the best university whether your teaching is the best or not. Thank you

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
i dont know how but when ever i need he repeats it.thx mr Strang


### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
True that. The best way I understand this is review. For Ex reading the chapter regarding vectors and 3 dimention math. Then you will be able to understand what the teacher is explaining. Personally I have a different way of learning and that is why I understand his clear lecture because of prior reviewing.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
at 11:16 he says he can describe it without any coordinates , but he actually  uses theta(angle as a coordinate)

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm surprised he couldn't integrate sqrt(2-cos(t)).

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
So, I got a question:
e is perpendicular to both a1, a2 and thereby, all the vectors of that lie in their plane. 

So, the dot product should be taken between a1 or a2 and e. Instead, we take the dot products of transposes of a1, a2 and e. 
So, if a vector is perpendicular to another vector, does that imply that its transpose will also be perpendicular to it?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
@[USERNAME]Because those are his reading glasses.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Absolutely not, I definitely encourage people asking questions, no matter how trivial it may seem. That's how we learn and understand things.
What I meant in my previous post was my surprise towards how a quality school would have admitted a student of this ability, who has problems manipulating fractions.  I just find it absurd, that's all.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thanks a lot!

In Linear Algebra, Professor Strang is God.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
I think Prof. Strang really hates Mr. Schmidt ;)

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
HOW Is this calculus, it seems more like linear algebra

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Okay, truth: Some of my friends were chosen (as freshmen) for internships in big european chem labs over european juniors and/or seniors, because the companies recognize how damn impressive this college is.  They were paid by the company to go halfway around the world and work for them for one summer, chosen instead of people that lived down the street and were equally smart, simply because they came from MIT.  That's the truth.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Even tho I can follow the steps, it's very very very difficult for me not to have the concepts leave my brain the moment I don't concentrate very very hard on this for hours. That's incredibly frustrating. I get it, but if I don't think about it for a couple days, I no longer will. And if you ask me to explain it, I cannot. But if you go thru it, I follow it. And yet I feel I've been bamboozled. And yet computers work, so I know it is true.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Amazing Professor we have here.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor Jerison is a joy to watch and listen to. He's really efficient, dare I say scarily efficient. I love the explanation of the derivative of y = arctan x with the right triangle and y as the angle.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I literally want to applaud after every lecture. If my linear algebra prof could communicate ideas this well, everyone in the course would definitely get an A.

### Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences
Bite of cookie

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I highly disagree with the resolution of the "notation problem" at 19'13". The problem is well stressed, but ill solved, if a cat ought to be called a cat! 

A little "mess" indeed is runing around there, in the lecture notation, and confusion is rising with paradox from a rather different cause than the one stressed out, if RIGOUR is to be called RIGOUR!

The little "mess" that is at the core of these confusions is simply that, through the change of variables, though 
f(x,y) = x+y = 2u+v = g(u,v), 
which are NUMERICAL EQUALITIES and which are NUMERICALY true, nevertheless the functions f and g ARE NOT the same since
f : (x,y) --> f(x,y)=x+y, 
and 
g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+v, 
WHICH IS equivalently written (since variables are "DUMMY VARIABLES") 
g : (x,y) --> g(x,y) = 2x+y.

From this rigourous functional (or algorithmical) way of looking at it,  it's obvious that f and g are DIFFERENT algorithms, that is DIFFERENT functions!

With things clarified this way, all confusions, danger, paradox... simply vanish : 
(df/dx)y = 1, 
and 
(dg/du)v=2 
No more pb!...

More over, be now clearly aware that we can write, with absolute rigour : 
(dg/du)v = (dg/dx)y, 
BUT ONLY IF YOU READ THIS IDENTITY IN THE PROPER WAY ONE SHOULD READ IT, THAT IS THROUGH "FUNCTIONS SPIRIT", AND NOT "number spirit". Why that? Because variables in these expressions, ARE AND MUST BE LOOKED AT, AS "DUMMY VARIABLES"! 

More precisely, what both of these expressions (dg/du)v or (dg/dx)y, trully mean, is simply and unambiguously : DIRIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST VARIABLE (OF THE ORDERED PAIR, OF THE CROSS PRODUCT OF SETS), KEEPING THE SECOND "VARIABLE" CONSTANT. 
Therefore we could equivalently have written (dg/dk)@  (or any crazy other "names" of variables), if we had defined the function "in such CHART", labeled (k,@),  by :
g : (k , @) --> 2k+@

THIS is the only way of puting things trully clearly and rigourously, without ever giving rise to any notation confusion or paradox! Simply by calling a function a function, and NOT "a cat a dog", messing around with words and concepts, through rather "physicist" lasy notations wich turns sometime to prove to be "bad" habits. 

It's in fact a CHAIN RULE MISTAKE that is arising when one misleadingly identify f with g. If one realy wants to differentiate with respect to the same variable, x for instance, keeping y constant, it is possible! But to perform that without any mess and mistake, one SHOULD NOT naively compare  (df/dx)y=1 with (dg/du)/v=2, wich are clearly DIFFERENT (and nothing wrong about it!). But instead, one SHOULD think "functionaly" instead of "numericaly"! That means one has to compute clearly the "CHAINED FUNCTION" G, which is different from g, but which is related to g by the Change of Variable. 

We thus express, first the change of variable in the PROPER WAY! That is, as the following FUNCTION :
C : (x,y) --> C(x,y) = (u,v) = (x, y - x)
We thus recall that the FUNCTION g is defined as the following algorithm :
g : (@,#) --> 2@ +#,
or equivalently (since what any function trully IS, IS it's defining ALGORITHM!), but more conveniently (for our CHAINING FUNCTIONS GOAL)  :
g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+v

These two FUNCTION are now wisely CHAINED to build the FUNCTION G defined as follow :
G(x,y) = g(u,v) = g( (u,v) ) = g(C(x,y)) = (goC)( (x,y) ) = (goC)(x,y)
We now clearly see what is this FUNCTION G : THE CHAINED FUNCTION OF g and C :
G = goC

The central "o" meaning the CHAINING (COMPOSITION) OPERATION ON FUNCTIONAL SPACE, defined, in general, for any two function A : E--> F, and B : F --> G, very simply as :
BoA : E --> G , x --> BoA(x) = B(A(x))
Which could thus, aternatively be named "THE BOA RULE" instead of the usual "fog" and "gof" of "FUNCTION CHAINING"... (joke!)

In our exemple we then get, finaly, since u=x and v=y-x :
G(x,y) = (goC)(x,y)  = g(C(x,y)) = g( (u,v) ) =  g(u,v) = g(x, y-x) = 2x + (y-x) = x +y
SO WE "DISCOVER" THAT for all x and all y, we have :
G(x,y) = f(x,y)
That means FUNCTIONAL EQUALITY :
G=f

So what have we done? Turning around? Yes, in a sens, because we have INSISTED in differentiating g with respect to x, IN A NUMERICAL SENS, instead of doing it in a FUNCTIONAL PROPER WAY that is, differentiating with respect to its FIRST variable in the ALGORITHM 
g : (@,#) --> g(@,#) = 2@ + #
Thus, in this NUMERICAL SENS, x is no longer a DUMMY VARIABLE, but a "NUMBER ATTACHED TO f"! The physicist would call it a "physical observable". This way of looking at things makes it complicate and cand lead to confusions if one doesn't clearly understand the CHAIN FUNCTION KEY AND THE IN FACT THE MANIFOLD CHARTS MAPPING (THUS CHANGE OF CHARTS TRANSFORMATIONS, often differentiable for a regular manifold) laying under all this...  

We thus have, in a sens, "turned around", leading to G=f! But doing so we nevertheless HAVE CLEARLY WRITEN THINGS IN CHAIN FUNCTION PROPER WAY, that reveal to be EXTREMELY USEFULL in higher and more abstract DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY, where crucial concepts of COVERING and UNIVERSAL COVERING, TANGENT SPACE, GROUP, LIE ALGEBRA, LIE DERIVATIVE, COVARIANT DERIVATIVE, CONNEXIONS, DIFFERENTIAL FORMS,..for instance, are usefully springing, needing CHAINING FUNCTION PROCESS to be clearly understood and mastered!

Finally, often, this abuse of notation which misleadingly sets f=g, will be handled without damage by the "human computer", with some habits and agility. BUT only in rather easy area. On the contrary it will lead to catastrophic confusions, misconceptions, darmatically false results and chear non sens interpretations, in more suttle area...alike, not for naming them, general relativity, riemanian differential geomedry, condensed matter, plasma, etc...

CHAINING FUNCTION OPERATION is one of the most simple, but important one in all mathematics! It's the building block of nested structures, one inside the others alike Pandora box, BUT "BOXES" THAT REVEAL FASCINATING STRUCTURES ALIKE GROUP, ALGEBRA, CLIFFORD,...TOPOS... : 
Points
Functions, from points to points
Functional (or Operator), from functions to functions, 
etc...
All included IN...CATEGORY Groetendick SPIRIT...deap!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The profession of teaching is being loved from all over the world as one of the most important profession of all time!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

sooooo what was x? lol

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]

Thats not what he's proofing though.  He's showing the sin(x)/x = 1, not 0.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
A*S=S*Lambda (Using the linear combination view (Ax1=b1 column part) of Matrix Multiplication), That is Brilliant and Clear! Thanks!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
This is an absolutely brilliant introduction to the theory of Probability. Many high school textbooks define probability as a frequency of possible outcomes to the total outcomes and get into counting problems. Students would quickly lose interest while solving myriad counting problems involving cards, dies, etc. and never see the bigger picture of probability. Here the professor instead choose to give a broader theoretical context behind the probability in the first lecture. Think what he did. He clearly defined his objective as to give a math framework to uncertainty faced in any field and started to systematically define the terms and rules. To begin with, we could call any uncertain activity that we are interested in, as an experiment and in that experiment, we could define a relevant sample space (he gives examples of irrelevant sample space to stress the importance of defining relevant ss) and then a probability law which quantifies our believes about how the outcomes in the sample space might occur. He stresses on this fact that probability law can be anything and need not be an empirical frequency which we usually observe. Probability of heads in a toss need not be 1/2 or probability of getting any one of the value when a six-sided die is rolled need not be 1/6. We assume them to be 1/2 or 1/6 because we empirically observe it and also logically it makes sense to assign those values when you know that the coin or the dice is not at all biased in any way. But some dices or coins due to their deformities   could favor certain outcomes and need not have equal fairness to all outcomes. This is such a revelation and not many realise this. He deals with uniform probability - finite sample space separately to make this point more clear. Also, the formulation of events that we are interested as subsets of possible outcomes and using pictures to find the probabilities of those events is absolutely beautiful.  He lays down the fundamental axioms and uses them wonderfully to derive the intuitive idea that probability of an event or a subset is nothing but the sum of probabilities of outcomes which are part of that event or subset. When we look at an event this way and also deal with uniform probability law (prob of each outcome is 1/N), we get probability of event as n/N where the formulation comes from  sum of n 1/Ns rather than dumbly solving counting problems for numerator containing possible outcomes of event and denominator containing all outcomes. This way of thinking helps one to understand and use probability theory beyond counting problems. Similarly, equivalence of probability to the areas while dealing with continuous distribution makes lot of sense and problem boils down to finding out the areas that our events occupy.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
27:28 I don't understand why they are considered projection matrices. Projection matrices from my limited understanding satisfy P=P^n, where n is any real integer. Projection matrices project a vector onto a certain subspace. Back in lecture 15, he derived P = A (A^T A)^-1 A^T. In the context of this lecture, A is an orthogonal matrix. Since A^T = A^-1 , P = A A^T. Does he therefore mean that q q^T are projection matrices in this sense?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Completely confused by 10:57. Can somebody explain what's the difference between union and his sum "+"?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I love his blinking single eye, literally. this man is great.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I can't believe the students start packing their stuff, slamming desks around, etc. at 48:30 before he's even done talking. So rude. They've just received a lecture by a brilliant mathematician, yet they have no respect!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
not one person has a question in any of these?  wtf

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Why is L half not a good norm? Why the P is restricted to be >= 1 instead of just p >0?

### 34. Final Course Review
Today I have completed the course; actually, I cannot be more proud to take this course and understand linear Algebra more than Any course that my uni gave me. Reckon that I am doing my masters in CS, and this basically is the key to everything since my uni bachelors failed to offer me reasonable mathematics courses.
I was never good at any major of mathematics, but right now, I feel I can rock any exam with the highest grade and enjoy studying for it. If there is a way to thank Dr Strang via email or something, tell me.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
The formula at the end is given as exercise in A first course in Probability by SM Ross. This Is really based on Combinatorics. The formula is based on combinations i.e. nCr or n combinations of r things at a time.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That black board paint on the walls sure does go a long way in these modern times!  That is a great idea if I ever get to teach again with all these budget cut backs!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does this have so many dislikes?

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
Very helpful to future students! Great work! Thank you!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
29:35 The vectors are not independent. 2*[2,2,5]-[1,1,2] = [3,3,8].

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mr. Jerison is super.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank for the person who asked for the 2nd row in min 8:55

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
5:03: big snow!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This makes me want to applaud.  I watched his summary lecture that reiewed this course and I damn near clapped in my home.  I should buy his book - I bought another one that's working fine, but didn't emphasize the row space column space null space left null space fundamental theorem of linear algebra picture that this course develops.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Wonderful teaching

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
What a good prof. At my school I have all sorts of questions but my prof doesn't take them. I wouldn't even need to ask in this class,

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I also want to point out something that most people would forget: the cameraman is very professional, always got the timing correct. It's really not a trivial work! The cameraman has to listen thoroughout the lecture and keep focusing on the right thing. A big thank you to the camera man as well!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
wish you a very long and healthy life, Professor Strang.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
Where can we find 18.06 from Alex Townsend? I would love to see more lectures from him, such a rich explanation

### Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
51:19 it is not straightforward to me why the BW theorem is correct given the previous theorem.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I just love Prof. Gilbert Strang. One of the best teachers humanity has to offer. To all those who haven't watched this playlist - This is the best way this subject can be taught.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
how come in the first example of the sphere F.nhat = a and not 1/a and in the second example H.nhat = z^2/a instead of az^2

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
you put them in there(the right angel notation which aide in comprehension and even more so for the visually impaired ) but not in the book fig 1.2 a quote from the forth objection   the omission of (what seem to be ) irrelevancies that give rise to contentions ,least the reader argue (self debate)over (perceived to be by the writer )inessential and so be prevented from perceiving what is important  ,  the space is there to define the object not the other way around , if a line is infinite  its space is so limited to the object/s with in it ,if not the space reflects its limits i.e its  dimensionality    its called ambiguity  , of course not there trained monkeys your tossing peanuts to

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Theres only 3 kinds of mathematicians: those who know how to count and those who don't.

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
👍🏼

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
What's the probability of someone entering the wrong lecture theatre at 28:37 ?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For z = z0 + a(x-x0) + b(y-y0),
wouldn't that mean:
-1(z-z0) + a(x-x0) + b(y-y0) = 0
so from lecture 4 the normal vector for any f(x,y) tangent plane is <-1, a, b> ?
I'm missing something about the -1 I'm sure

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
excelente !!!!

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
colombia exploded because a welder slacked on an o ring u idiot dont fuck up facts. columbia exploded causee of power point lol wow u are smart

### 13. Regression
He is one of the worse teachers.  He needs to do better job of preping for the lecture or he just stop teaching.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
I'd like to say, this video is the best I've ever seen. The instructor's mind is very clear so that he can relate all critical notions together and depicts vivid images for us in brief.

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
thank you MIT

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
It’s been a journey Professor Strang. It’s quite sad that this has come to an end, but what a beautiful way to come full circle.

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone failing after the doc's lectures for a semester should be arrested and banished to Siberia

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
1 + w + w^2 + ...  + w^{n-1} = (1 - w^n )/ ( 1 - w )

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
The mistake starts at 11:26. The right hand side is (1 2 2), not (1 2 3). But he later uses the (1 2 2) for all other calculations, so not a big deal.

### Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
horrible camera work

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
oh i'm still in highschool and i can understand and apply everything he's taught!
I was wondering why he was taking his glasses off all the time

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
There are just few people all the way getting there , glad I did it also

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
25:20
Not every one at MIT is a nerd!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks ,,,,

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Now I am wondering that all those students are 11 years older than me




2020 ( During Lockdown)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I actually found this lecture hard to follow. I've taken Single Variable Calc and the Probability course from MIT on EDX, and found those teachers' rhythm much easier to follow. Here it feels like the professor is jumping from one train of thought to another , making it difficult to follow.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
18:26 isn’t N1 with ab not only in q3/q4 but also in q1?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Hello! Does anybody know any other lecturers like Dr. Strang with such passion in fields like convex optimization, detection estimation or probability theory?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]they can afford best chalks in the world. these chalks consist about 28% of calcium this why these chalks very tough and u can draw long straight lines. and if someone have trouble with teeth it can be eaten as well. but before u need smash chalks or scrape off whiteboard and mix it with some limon- or other acid. without acid you wont consume calcium. they called also eatable chalks.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'm tunisian estudent, 

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Thank you, MIT for making this publicly available and for free. 
Thanks, Youtube for storing and serving the content.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
got another way of slightly less clumsy integrating to pi/8
cos^4(t)=cos^2(t) - cos^2(t) sin^2(t)=cos^2(t)-1/4 sin^2(2t)

double angle formulae again, original integrand becomes
3/8+1/2 cos(2t) +1/8 cos(4t)

happy integrating

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Are elimination and elementary matrices the same? Some books mention elementary matrices and others don't, so I wanted to know!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
8:55 Min why does he want to avoid A to be singular? don´t quite understand...the only reason i see (in hindsight), is that the step, he does at 12:30 Min (rewriting LU with a diagonal matrix in the middle) wouldn´t be unique. But i assume, there must be another reason.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
excellent

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does undergraduates in the us only learn about calculus  when the reach university at 18, in the uk we learn't about it a 15 

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Thank you prof I'm writing a exam tomorrow morning

### 12. Iterated Expectations
ngl, good video, but thumbnail creeeeeeep

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
when i hear eigenvalue, I think of Häagen-Dazs®

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I have so much difficulty coping with my Linear Models subject. Thank you prof for this! You're a blessing. Continue uploading your lectures. You are a great help to us!

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Fine lecture, amazing offering, PLUS, in the scuffs, dusts, and blears of the chalkboard panels, a poetry in black I haven't seen since Ad Reinhardt!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Nice tie. :)

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
43:20 Why students are laughing?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
why is |e^(6it)|=1?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Immortal

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
I am shocked at 40:48, why isn't there any students at the lecture hall?

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
I dont understand why individuals dont always make the sample space explicit. That way, a nonconditional probability is conditional on the given sample space. It shows that probability is dependant on sample space and there can be varying specification of it.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
So nice and educative sir

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]that would be great, the problem is  how..:D

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is really a good video, it helps a lot for my entrance exam. Thank you so much!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Parlez-vous français?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
i have finished 18.06 and i thought that i wont see professor gilbert and the infinite black black board together in  a video again 
pretty happy :D

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Any subspace must contain vector (0,0,0), otherwise, if you do w*0 the answer would not belong to the subspace.

If the plane doesn't go through the origin, it's not a subspace.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Inspiring

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Amazing…

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great additional material to help with clarifying my studies.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally finished the whole 18.01 playlist. 
Thank you Prof. Jerison and Prof. Muller. I have finally understood the essence of single variable calculus which I could not for several years. Now in my 4th year of engineering, I can finally appreciate the beauty of calculus. Thank you very much. 🙏🙏🙏

02/01/2023, India

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
That is why MIT is called the "Mecca of Engineering". Brilliant !!!!!!!!!

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I believe there is an issue on 18.01sc (on the MIT OCW website): One of the recitation videos asks us to be aware of representing functions as series before it is introduced.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Actually, very few people use iPods today 20190124

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The natural log is just a massive piece of junk 🤣

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
He is my guru

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Can someone help me? Around 30:0 to 33:33 I don’t understand that multiplication. To me it doesn’t look the A matrix is equal to the transposed matrix times the identity matrix. One time zero is zero. Not one. (From top row of second column)

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
How do we get the picture (triangle) in the stick-breaking example which is later used to get the limits of the integral

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Is it sufficient to follow along with this video playlist and do the problems on the OCW website or should one work through the textbook alongside? 
I'm a third year engineering student in europe (mechatronics engineering), but my school doesn't go heavy on theory and only teaches bachelor's students the bare minimum of linear algebra.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
35:25  Piecewise linear conferences... multiple dimensional dry humor!

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ 50:18

Now I see, guess I made the same mistake. It is -1.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The first lecture is simple even for 2* speed. Youtube needs an option for 4* speed with subtitles, so that we can skip simple things and learn more in less time.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
EA= R; the EAR rule

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
I have a small doubt, what if we assume that population parameter itself is a random variable, not a constant in frequentist sense, can quadratic risk still be decomposed into Bias and Variance like this?

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Thanks sir

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Wizard of LA

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
35:00

### 7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars
I'm honestly so glad these lectures are posted

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Line integrals in space, curl, exactness and potentials

### 17. Markov Chains II
46:47 "It's a very popular model for modeling people who are drunk" lol

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
pointless no talent teacher.

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
I am missing a reference to the population when explaining expected mean and expected variance. Then you sample the population for a sample mean and/or a sample variance.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I chose number 8. Why would it be 7 instead of 8? 7 and 8 have the same probability to attain?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT, and can you PLEASE post the names of these wonderful professors so we can thank them by name too?? I go to a small community college and our instructors are wonderful.... but.. not quite like this :)  These videos make me feel smart again when I was starting to ask myself "what's wrong with my brain??"

### 18. Properties of Determinants
While in high school (in India), I used to hate matrices, determinants, and vectors. They taught it like they were just a bunch of mindless, random calculations. Prof. Strang gives meaning to all of them and linear algebra has suddenly become wayyyy more interesting!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]all he wants is, that you get a better view for that what he wants you to see. that why he writes it that way

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
rubbish

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
here you go down to problem set and find which tasks were given to each lecture:
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/pages/assignments/


and here you find the homework with solutions(as a bonus there are supplementary notes):
https://math.mit.edu/~jorloff/suppnotes/suppnotes01-01a/index-01A.html

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
At the run time 38:20, regarding the third possibility of SUB SPACES of R^2, zero vector only.
If we add any vector other than zero vector to the zero vector, wouldn't the vector be shifted to another position rather than staying at zero vector position i.e. won't it jumps out of specified vector space?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
i think at 44:58 it should be 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 not 1/2 +1/2 =1

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I'm guessing this was a re-do lecture, probably due to some recording malfunction when they first recorded it. It would be odd to have a packed room for lecture 4 and then have no one show up to lecture 5, haha.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Not gonna lie, the last video I saw of him was from 2015. I fought he was dead. so good to see him again

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
'if i had a prof like him' statement in my head

### 34. Final Course Review
thank you prof. Strang. you are brilliant!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At min 26:00 by double differentiate f(0) it comes 51/8 and it's much faster to put zero in e^x and x

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
13:31 Flat Earth confirmed!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's good to know that you know how to copy and paste Google search results.

I can't believe you are trying to gain an "I'm so smart" off of YouTube. Fucking sad.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm disappointed he didn't write down Euler's Identity in the end :(

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
9:13 i've never realized that! awesome!

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished single variable course 18/05/19 thanks a lot MIT, someday I'm going to donate money for this incredible resource thay you give us.. carry on with this quality at education!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Such a legendary professor. He rocks! :)

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
mit still uses chalkboards. while my shitty hs has marker boards and smart boards. parady?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
|det|,absolute value

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wish i could become a MIT student one day.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone explain why he leaves out the abs() sign when saying integrating u'/u to get ln(u)
>> Shouldn't it be ln|u| ?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
very good teacher, very helpful video

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Crystal clear see through.Excellent.

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
Proof of Markov Inequality: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality#Proof_in_the_language_of_probability_theory

### 3. Independence
Given one of the children became a king, we know it's a boy. So, now there are 4 possibilities.
1. Male, King
2. Female, King
3. King, Male
4. King, Female

(First born first)

In this, it's safe to assume '1' didn't happen, as in that case the king wouldn't be the king. So, we got three possibilities with 2 of them having a female sibling. Thus probability is = 2/3.

Doesn't this make more sense?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
this is mind-blowing
i don't fully understand it
but i know it's mind-blowing

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
procedury ai tygłupku zostały zbudowane na krzywych fundamentach.ai

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The only question I'm now left with is what the hell is "a real New England weekend".

### Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem
I remember when the 4 color was a lived controversy.

### 11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit
Where is the class 10 video?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
With lectures this good I can watch this instead of Netflix. I have one professor who also hold phenomenal lectures and lectures this good bring me as much joy or even more than playing a good video game or watching a good show. It is interesting and entertaining and it blows my mind. Truly a fantastic job! Thank you professor Strang!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]How the guy manages to expose concepts. Now... if you value the education as a function of it's price (that seems to be the usual criteria for americans), you're not being educated, you're being sold a product. This is why american science of today has to graze its intelectual power from escaped minds from the former soviet union, china, and india: you simply can't produce good scientists, just good salesmans. Aside from very honorable examples, american science has been made by foreigns

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
His name is Gilbert Strang, mathematician.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Where does n^2 - n come from and how is it obtained? Is it just the initial nuber of hats mutliplied by th remaining number after 1 is correctly selected?

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
In case of normal distribution you say that when sigma smaller then that parabola will narrower but if we take sigma getter than 1 then opposite situation happened. Please explain it.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Can the determinants that compute the triangle(not including origin) be generailized to n dimension? I look around internet but found nothing related.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
What combination should we take? Why not the right combination what the hell🤣

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Hey MIT, you guys rock for putting up such exquisite material online for free. I will definitely be making a small donation for such a great cause.  

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
you are really a good teacher.  When u teach Math it's like  flawless.  I am truly inspired sir

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thank you

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Touching！

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
at 31.40 can I also say that a matrix is invertible only if linear combination of its columns can create vectors which are linearly independent.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Micro printing

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Gave me some insight, Thanks. I liked the part about how u^TSu is the variance of the X's along the u direction. Good to know for an alternative viewpoint to Singular value decomposition as a PCA.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
just wow

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Finally! We start with a clean board.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dude the professor is freaking awesome.i have fallen in love with maths cause of him

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
note: there are 5 ways to think of matrix multiplication.
1. cij=Sum[aik*bkj,{k,1,n}]
2. (Matrix*column=column), Columns of C are combination of columns of A.
3. (row*Matrix=row), Rows of C are combination of rows of B.
4. AB=sum of (columns of A)(rows of B).
5. We can cut matrix into blocks.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love it. Thanks MIT!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
26:59 I'm sorry, I don't get this. w takes both positive and negative values. How does that lead to saddle point?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
HOW IS THIS FREEE!!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
9:11 "I can assign anything that I like for X2 and X4..."

So, what's stopping us from choosing the free variables as X2 and X3? Because, it seems clear from the equations that they can be assigned any value arbitrarily.

Somebody!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How come he considered a hyperbola that passed by (x=0) and (y=0) simultaneously ???
at 46:55 .

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
his 7 looks like a 1 and thats really confusing :D
But as always great lecture!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I love this guy.

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
I'm back! 🤓

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
i still do not understand how it works , F and I definitely can have different shapes ? This part is not clear from the video.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
More than twenty years after college, I stumbled upon the gem that is MIT 18.06 taught by Professor Strang. Watching him giving the lectures on the subject really changed my understanding of and perspective on some of the basic concepts of linear algebra. I would like to imagine Professor Strange as the great mentor I never had the luck to have in real life, and I am so lucky to finally find him on the Internet through MIT OCW. Thank you sir!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
This video is amazing! AMAZING! All the principles fit reality so nicely! LONG LIVE MATRICES.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
how the heck are those people mit students?

### 13. Bernoulli Process
He is excellent, indeed. His ability to explain simply is great

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I have taken several Probability and Random Proceses at different stages in my academic background career as well as many Advanced Stochastic Processes in many Electrical Engineering fields [Control Systems, DSP; Communication Systems, Radars, Electromagnetics, Machine Learning, DSP....].  It is really a pleasure to attend virtually to the lectures of Professor John Tsitsiklis.  He makes probability a wonderful experience !!!  Pd. I have a question for him that makes me think:  Normally advanced  sophisticated radar systems have PROBABILITY OF FALSE ALARM in the order of 10^-6 to 10^-10. Though his probability decision tree for the DETECTION of a plane is a wonderful really great and pretty neat  example for the derivation of conditional probabilities, why did You use only a probability of false alarm [PFA] of 0.10?  Isn´t it too high for advanced state of the art Radar Systems receivers Rx?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This is another excellent video on transposes, permutations and vector spaces. This is the real part of linear algebra.

### 34. Final Course Review
I suppose that’s why MIT is not for every student and why it is difficult and costly to get into. This course review requires a special level of mastery of the material, which assumes a great deal of understanding and problem practice throughout the course. When a matrix is not square and doesn’t have a unique solution (independent rows or columns) all kinds of scenarios could happen. Adding to that, whether the matrix is orthogonal, orthonormal, symmetric, positive or semi definite, as well as others involving Eigenvectors, values, pivots and determinants. I suppose that the best way to wrap all that information around the head is to start with some simple 2 by 2 or 3 by 3 matrix and experiment with all different scenarios using a good software package to spit out the output and see how the theory works. I am using scientific notebook.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This video should be included in every teacher preparation/training/professional development program ... and learn the lessons and apply them.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Language of column space , OMGGG <3

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
In case you , like me, are wondering what this video is exactly - He's doing a recap of the first 12 lectures. This is NOT him going through the solutions of a quiz that the students sat. Rather, it's him reviewing the material so far before the students have the quiz.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He explained it actually. Tangent plane is horizontal meaning that there is no lower or higher value than f(x,y) other than the intersection point of the tangent plane and the function.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
if you find this lecture challenging, it might be because you forget some basic linear algebra. Don't be discouraged by the somewhat trivial algebraic calculation. the Prof does a very good job in explaining the intuition and statistical foundation for doing PCA. PCA is so commonly used in psychology studies, yet no one in the my Psy department seem to have a clue where PCA is coming from.

### 3. Parametric Inference
MIT can't figure out how to apply a filter to the audio to remove the hiss?

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
The phenomenon he mentioned in the first 5 minutes is a very interesting psychological question. Is it about the sequential effects of decision making? Anyone knows the field? Please feel free to share some papers. Thank you.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I Really Like The Video Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n From Your

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
pretty interesting to hear in min 25 about "fat tails in finance and the morgage scandal". This was recorded in Fall 2007, and 15 years later we're still feeling the effects of the 2008 economic crisis.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I got confused when he said that the column space of two 3-D vectors will be a plane (The column space of two 2-D vectors was also a plane, so, there won't be any difference in any column space?). Isn't the linear combinations of two 3-D vectors supposed to fill out the entire 3-D plane?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
This class is concerning of the the product of two huge matrices A and B,  assuming in the simple case that  A is [a,b], and B is [cT,dT], and the algorithm is that we choose one column from A and one row from B. For instance, we might choose column a from A and row cT(c transpose) from B, and then we do out product of these two vectors to get a*cT, this will serve as a sampling to simulate (or one of our guesses) the real product AB. As we accumulate more and more of the samples, if we sum all of these out-products together, we will gradually approach the real answer AB. His calculation on the [a, 0], [b,0] business in the fist part is only tryting to capture on average how the algorithm is dealing with one  of the components A in the product AB.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I am taking linear algebra class at my own college. It's a top 20 university, but the professor totally messes stuff up! He didn't even emphasize the closure of linear combination when he introduced vector space! I thought linear algebra is super hard but I realized it's actually not after I watched this video! 

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
i have never been so lost in my entire life.....

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
for cycloid the proof was given in terms of angle,later it was told that at radius =1 and speed=unity, angle may be replaces with time.thus r vector of cycloid was arrived at in terms of t.
also using this r in terms of t, speed was calculated as  sqrt(2-2cost).
my question is when  relation in terms of t was arrived at by using speed =unity,why it is coming as sqrt(2-2cost) ?

it would be great if we have video lecture for commutative algebra as well

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]knew* i think your should look at some lower level education videos.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
15:02 interested information inside matrix - eigenvalues

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree. during the period i was introduced to calculus, i had no problem with the derivative, but did so with the integral, because it didnt seem very intuitive to me. it shocked me that knowing the area under a curve of a function only depended on two points. and teachers or textbooks didnt realy explain why that was. it seemed shocking to me at the time. but with further investigation i found out all the terms between canceled out, and that helped my thought so much.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Months later, I'm doing the exact same thing.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I am not in the class but I still watched the first 13:20 minutes

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would love a board like this. My actual teachers write so fast and they just erase the whole thing before I have time to copy. (I write slow)

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
So clear the explanation is that for a simple matrix (3X3) I can directly flush out the inverse matrix given the multiplier at each elimination step, without going thru matrix inverse and multiplication. 
Here is the process:
(1) Flip the sign of multiplier at each elimination step. 
(2) Directly add it in the L matrix in the same position (index) of L. 
In the example of 18:00, flip (-2) I get 2, then add 2 in position L[2,1]; flip (-5) I get 5, add 5 in position L[2,3]. So I got L.

BTW, another way to understand that L is better than E is that: 
(1) When producing E, there are interfered operations happening and thus a new (implicit) relationship between row1 and row3 is formed. As a result, a new entry (10) is appearing to reflect the newly created (implicit) relationship among row1 and row3, as shown at the position E[3, 1]. 
(2) When producing L, the operations are in the right order that there are no interfered operations thus no implicit relationships were generated. So we can just plug in the multiplier (the entry) directly to L, without worrying about missing any entries. 
(3) As a side note, the entry value tells about the multiplication, BUT more importantly, the index of each entry tells about he the relationship between rows. Eg. In matrix E32, the entry E[3, 2] = -5, it means the change coming from row2 to row3, with (-5) as the amount. Getting an explicit explanation on the role of entry indexes helps a lot to build some intuitive in a long run.

Thank you Dr. Strang. You are the hero of Linear Algebra!

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Excellent lecture

can anyone explain to me what the dx in the indefinite integral stands for? Ive heard that it can be interpreted in different ways.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
A lot of examples in this video that show why the cameraman would be better if he/she could follow the subject matter - the camera is left showing the wrong part of the blackboard.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thanks a lot prof Strang, the way you explained transposes is so clear. I can't thank you enough.

2:46, guy next to white shirt ded lol

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great lecture

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The only issue I have with Calculus currently is a fundamental one.  Basically, the entire premise relies on shaky ground...a limit.  This is an approximation.  In theory, you never achieve an exact answer, because you have to make an uncertain assumption that as you actually plug in zero, the exact answer is achieved.  This is the flaw of trying to describe a continuous space with descrete mathematics.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
It helps a lot Polytechnique Montreal students, cuz we re using Gilbert Strang book translated and course

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
This lesson is so good. But I would suggest that he takes a short pause from time to time. It is tiring to listen continuously.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
42:28 pure beauty

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
At 5:38, what if b is not in column space nor perpendicular to column space?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
His way of teaching is very engaging and intuitive. He kind of eases the viewers into the topic and makes them visualise bit by bit until he and the viewers both arrive at the same conclusion and understanding. To me that's art. Not too many professors or any kind of speakers for that matter are able to do that. One can also view his love and fascination for everything he teaches. It's just great. Thankyou for your lectures professor Strang. 👍👍👍

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I have a question, he said that if we rewrite the matrix as 
R = [ I  F
         0 0]
and if the nullspace is N = [ -F
                                                 I]

then RN = 0. But when you do the multiplication you get : -IF + FI, but I and F are matrices which means that FI and IF are not the same. So what's going on here?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Wow!! What an amazing professor. I'm in the middle of his course on Linear Algebra, pursuing knowlegde to get a better base for studying Machine and Deep Learning in the near future. Guess I'll rush it a little bit, got very anxious to start this new one hahah sounds spetacular. Thank you MIT and Professor Strang <3 cheers from Brazil

I am from yemen.I really just want to appreciate the knowledge he have and how much he gives. 
 I never heard someone like this miracle. I starting loving probability

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
I watched this once, taking all notes. Then watched it again (with break) without taking notes. Then I read my notes (after a break). The lecture's quite good! Btw for those that thought the second derivatives thing came out of left field, Du is the directional derivative operator, so you want Du( Du( f(x1,x2,...,xn) ) ), which gives the expressions for x^T*A*x for a connected f and A. This tells us that x^T*A*x is like a second order operation for the derivative of a function when A is the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives) of said function f(). This wasn't clear to me initially so I was kinda lost. Best!

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
This is another masterpiece by the grand dragon of mathematics DR. Gilbert Strang. I did not have any professor at the University of Maryland College Park in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering  in the 1990's that makes math and science easy to understand. This professor is incredible in every math lecture/video at MIT.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
man this guy is awesome. you can def integrate the function at @20:20 just use a Weierstrass substitution!!!!

### 34. Final Course Review
i finish the course at Germany 06.11.2020 watch this in last 5 day with 1,5x speed. inspiring me alot, thank you Dr. Strang.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice lecture but i can always hear COS product rather than CROSS product...

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
On 45:55 he says that any two linearly independent vectors would span the C(A). But these two linearly independent vectors should also be in C(A) he forgot to mention that i think. Because (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) are linearly independent but they do not span C(A). I listened carefully that part 3 times before writing this comment but maybe I missed it.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
kookoo transpose

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

my english is not good enough but this guy teaches better than my teacher speaking my native language

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love mathematics, because I like  true reasoning, the problem seems to be the language, I told my friends that I saw more truth in 3dMax of Autodesk because its language is perfect, they use objects, transformation, parameters, functions... but all these words are always in the right place, here I have no problems understanding, geometry, algebra, arithmetic, the problem arises when different variables come into the ecuation and notations are not rigurous such as confusing a line with a plane

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
integrating 'x^-1' ... produces Ln(x) ... obviously this is a unique function.  This lecture holds insights but I'm going to have to read up on integration more & more to appreciate this lesson.  Many of these lessons can not be grasped without prior study , in my opinion

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is extremely thorough and the "simplicity" of the material is only a testament to his teaching ability. He's teaching vectors, and its not like "mit vectors" would be something different, special, or requiring genius to understand simply because the school has a prestigious reputation. If your school's reputation isn't as recognized as mit's your frustration should be directed towards the morons who can not appreciate anything other than what someone else tells them is the "best."

@[USERNAME]Well ok .... allmighty America :D.... we don't have money to finance research... i think it will take a bit to have Motor driven power Blackboard... :D Anyways a blackboard is a blackboard...the basic ones are fine.. all u need to know ...is what to write on them..and somebody that understands what is written ;)

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I may be stupid but, whats so different about him in teaching? I didnt understand my teacher when he taught this to us, and other things in Linear algebra too. And since everyone is praising this guy, I thought he teaches differently, but still I'm not understanding anything again, maybe Im just stupid and never will get LA.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Great lectures (19/20) but same remark than in lect5, there is great confusion between VECTOR SPACE and AFFINE SPACE, and in particular between the AFFINE ORIGINE (0,0,0) and the 0 VECTOR. The 0 vector is NO WHERE. He's NOT living in affine space. Actualy this aparent paradoxes can only be overcome by driling to the heart of the true definition of a vector space. For the 1-dim vector space, they are by serious definition an EQUIVALENT CLASS of infinitely many parrallel affine lines that fill the entire plane. Similarely a 2-dim vestor space is an equivalent class of infinitely many parallel affine planes that fill the entire 3-space R^3. The key word is thus, REPRESENTATION (Vorstellung in German). An affine line is a particular REPRESENTATION, a "minister" of a "King" which give the DIRECTION : the 1-dim VECTOR SPACE. Similarly an affine plane is a particular REPRESENTATION, a minister of a "King&Queen" which fix the TWO-DIRECTION : the 2-dim VECTOR SPACE

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lecture on higher order differential equations are available??????

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why am I only finding this now?

This might be the difference between passing and failing 18.01 for the first time since I took it in 1972.

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
excellent course, thank you professor

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
thank you :)) 
you are amazing

Good old days at cs university...

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
His existence is a gift for seekers of knowledge!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
thank Sir....!
I guess that not all MIT lecturers are great but I am very sure this guys is really amazing. I like him

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT .. for these Quality content ❤️❤️ ,,, thanks a lot ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I can't describe my respect for you 🙏

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
At 10:27 how are we calculating E21( elimination matrix)?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is he french?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
LOL "for like, 48 different reasons, that determinant is zero. so this one is dead." Heehee. Amazing video and series - thank you!! :)

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
50:30 lol

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
everyone wonder why the professor didn't write ln y as ln |y|. my main language is not English but I watched the video four times to understand completely. very critical to sum up the part of the video's interval 14:30 - 19:00 . When is used the non-linear approximation, something should seem unnecessary for a short time.For example, If ve implement the y = 0 on the where equation beginning is dy/y the method won't be operated. professor said you will always face with these problem. if we consider all thing earlier, solution couldnt be reach ant useful information. the solution requires more information like y(0) = 3. Then the solution could be more considerable. I think professor wants to teach only solution approach at that part. This is my thought. if I am false please reply the true perspective of the solution.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
14:45: such as beautiful picture

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
im a CSE student from india and litrally These videos are proving that Why MIT is best in the world....

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@[USERNAME]u are right..but what if u look @ the two first rows? its also the same..

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The problem shown in the video at 13:22 can't be found anywhere at http://ocw.mit.edu/18-02F07...

12:33

Cleaning up the 3-2 position

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is the best.  thank you MIT !!!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I dare him to prove the other letters in the alphabet as well. Him proving "e" is not enough. I want to see him prove 'f', 'g', 'h', and so on. That is the real test for a mathematician.

### 4. Counting
1.  Are students permitted to arrive late for lectures thereby disrupting the attention of other, more courteous students?  2.  Must every sentence start with "so?"

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
First to comment lol

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Thankyou Professor.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
In other places, the DFT matrix has a minus in the exponential  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT_matrix). What am I missing here?

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
It's interesting that some professors still write a bunch of definitions and equations on a chalk board the way it has been done for well over 120 years.  A lot of that could be written out and provided to the students before class; this would permit the professor to spend more time answering questions and analyzing the information during class.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Dove chocolate is not smooth as silk. This lecture is. indeed

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I love this man!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i watch 3 lectures of his every week.  This is amazing.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I thought Walter Lewin is awesome.Seeing this prof. I feel continuing.Awesome!!!!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Professor strang is master of teaching
He is an artist.
His way of teaching is a masterpiece.
Thank you Sir.
Respect, from India

### 17. Markov Chains II
One awesome thing we can do is to skip certain parts if you knew / don't care about them. I wish I could do this in real life with real professors (lol)

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
nvm lol you corrected it.... I hate the new youtube layout.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
how old is he!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:00 - have been fascinated by Dr. Jerison's lecture series, but at this particular moment the lead to the use of quadratic approx. is unclear to me.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If I see the drawing of the vector field, how can I interpret it as he did with the example 8:48?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gonna remember 18.02 for a long time!! Will miss you professor!!!t this makes me sad

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do maths/science/engineering students take this class or some other multivariable calculus course like 18.024?

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much! Professor Strang and MIT OpenCourseWare for making this happen! you are amazing! you made it possible for me to study Linear Algebra during the COVID Time. And this is one of the best Math I have ever taken in my life. I did not take Linear Algebra at college bc I did not like how it was taught. This course is the perfect one that I was waiting for. It's simple and beautiful, intuitive and reasonable! It explains all the logics behind these equations and formulas. It's the essence of it! I Thank you VERY MUCH!         -  LOVE!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
thank you very much prof, very good lecture

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
In the 3X4 matrix example, shouldn't the dim Null(A transpose) be 4-2= 2 instead of 3-2=1?

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Why does everybody hates Taylor's Series.They are a live saver and allow you to do so much with a little work.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Why so much noice? no wonder why too few views compared to earlier lectures.

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Thank you SIR.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉been waiting for this for a long time

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Excellent lecturer with great style.  Jimmy Stewart teaches linear algebra.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
what's the intuition behind 'Ax = b has no solution, however Transpose(A) Ax = Transpose(A) b has a solution'. 
I am having a hard time

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
professor Strang helped me for my entire linear course, thanks!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
老爷子万寿无疆！Gilbert is God!

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Man, there is a LOT of coughing happening in the background. In 2021, if someone is coughing that much then clear the fucking room!

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why this lecture is not being downloaded on Idm?


### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
the explanation starting at 25:10 helped me understand what a positive definite matrice is

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just my opinion -- If you want to appreciate these lectures, it is better to concurrently take a Physics 1 & 2 -- There are Prof. Walter Lewin's or Prof. Ramamurthy Sankar's full courses in YouTube. That way, it is very easy to connect the Work, Curl, Flux etc. more easily. This applies to Linear Algebra as well as the lectures are great to understand, but applications get a bit complicated..

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
MIT has still got it. What a time to be alive that we can watch this for free

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I had some trouble connecting the two pictures.  What helped me to understand the connection is rewrite the original equation as Ax = b = e + p.  That means we breaking down b into the error vector and its projection, p, onto A.  We find e1, e2, e3, which are the elements of the error vector, by solving for C and D such as e is in the null space of A transpose.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
this is awesome, Gilbert Strang you save me!

### 34. Final Course Review
@[USERNAME], in your example r< m :)....the LHS of two equations are not independent.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Gauss would quit, but Jordan says keep going.

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Statistics is nothing else
1.deviation
2.mean
Equals, 
Understanding primes
Equals, 
The clay institute statement about riemann hypothesis:
1.The PNT determines the average distribution of the primes. 
2.The riemann hypothesis tells us about the deviation from the average. Average mens statistical mean or 0
Stochastic means 0
Statistis means 0.
Order means 1.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
proofs are something you can look up in the text book or online. for me, they are also something I see in regular lecture. it's nice that the MIT videos are straight to the point.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
that -2 at 9:00 killed me :(

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
45:40 gilbert strang equivalent of leaving a high five hanging

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
So abstract. Use examples to help students distinguish between different formulae. Lecturer is well intentioned and I blame the institutions for producing grads who can't apply the content they learn

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I'll add this to my watch later list, because I am going to need this when I do Mathematical Methods at UWA next year.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
If anything stands out from these videos is the teachers humbleness - if this word exists.

They are modest and clear and respectful. And this is so rare these days.

Thank you, MIT!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Thank you.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Well, these are the non-science majors... ;)

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
fking google can't even reply to comments. Anyway ppl may learn this shiet early on in other countries, but once we mature, Americans rush through this stuff really quickly. calc 1 to diff. equations in 2 years. There is a reason why US is the prime hub of innovation and it has a lot to do with our superior high education system.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
This guy is an absolute genius.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
In u naught = c1x1 + c2x2 .... Cnxn what are X's the vectors of?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you, Prof. Auroux and MIT! I learn it from lec 1 to the lec 32. 兴隆--2017.11.12

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can MIT OCW please make short video lecture series complemented with interesting problems, so that it is easier and more effective to learn?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Since all eliminations must be done by computers for large matrices, intuitive approaches fail quickly. So, precise rigorous algorithms are the only practical way to do elimination. Gilbert Strang style defies the rigorous approach, and does it on purpose to breath life into the dull process of elimination.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Literally ,the legend of linear algebra

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i feel honored to be able to listen to a MIT, math professor. I am trying to teach myself calculus this summer but his lecture is kinda advanced for me at this moment. lol.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
What a disappointment after 18.06.... - I don't know what this course is for and what this lecture is aiming to achieve. I shall stop here after 13 lectures. Anyone familiar with courses covering the math that's related to machine learning? Not popular science basics - but deep dive?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think Prof Jerison mixed up the Hare with the Tortoise in this one. The Hare is the one playing catchup, not the Tortoise (in the original, it was Archilles trying to catch up with the the Tortoise).

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is a good teacher..

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Hi, anyone know how did p=xa become p=ax. 

aTb/amag^2 a = aaT/amag^2 b ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 24:29 a student asks a very elementary algebraic manipulation question, nothing beyond class 6 in India. Is this really MIT?

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Pure gold. Amazing to hear that emphasis in LinAlg has been shifting until so recently (Jordan out of fashion, SVD to the forefront). Because of computational characteristics?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I can't find lecture summary, anyone please help...

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
What John Sheley did was beyond questioning the usefulness of Linear Algebra...he denounced the entire realm of academia. Little bit of a discrepancy there...

I don't think that his absurdly detrimental insinuations should be taken so lightly...

Burn him! He's conspiring with the devil! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]He does the exact same thing at 7:47. You surely passed out some seconds before this :)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he's fabulous

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much Pro Strang let me realized how beautiful mathematics can be!

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He’s crazy smart

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Thanks professor strang, really useful!!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really have learnt all of thesein high school but my teachers never explain it clearly but rather force me to remember the equations and do the problems. That ways of study left me lots of knowledge gaps. I should have realized it earlier. 😭😭😭

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Wow

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone explain to me the relationship between implicit differentiation and taking the total differential of a function? Is it that with implicit differentiation the function is set equal to a fixed point? THANKS!

Can anyone tell me what's the age of the students taking this course and what are they studying? 

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Dr. Strang, it was your course that introduced me to algebra back in high school. - from University of Toronto, after quantum mechanics final exam

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Dear Professor Strang...  Please make many more interesting courses for the next 1000 years.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the text book for this course


### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Maza aa gaya bhai!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Legend 🙏

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
... only because he was born earlier... and died earlier .... )))))))))) I fond of his comments... This is how I call "to make digits interesting to look at ..." !!!

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
bro his rhos are so ugly

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Does it count as breaking the fourth wall that he talks about compression of this video?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
TBH, I did not like his method of teaching it's too abbreviated. It's like the student there were master hahaah maybe and maybe I am the problem. Good Luck.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
False. kilowatt-hour *is* a unit of energy.

How about *you* use the metric system and learn what the units actually represent.

Nice fail, sir.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]not actual idiots. i was actually responding to another person's comment. i was being somewhat exaggerated.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
The thing I really like about these old timer Professors are the way they teach, he stops and ask questions as if he is also going through the problem he already knows everything but in the moment he is walking through us students and trying to look problems through our eyes, I would say this is the greatest method of teaching.

### 4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions
At 13:17-13:28 he wanted |U| = s, whoever did the lecture notes writeup for this class fixed it there.

I had to watch this lecture twice; the randomized probabilistic construction in the second half seems pretty sophisticated.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
he's really funny :)

### 34. Final Course Review
The course was extremely useful for me. Thanks a lot.


### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank you.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
u just sumarized my 12 hours of studying in 50 mins

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Every Software? That in't really true. Especially in Computer Science there are a lot of areas where you basically will never hear from Linear Algebra again.

But to question the usefulness of LinAlg is of course laughable. 

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I really appreciate this course and I hope complex analysis lectures will come out soon

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man... what´s this?? MIT??? This is the most basic Mathmatic Analysis you can find around here (PT) !! 1st derivative??!! That´s Pre-University work... Man, I hope, and I know you´re better than this... I envy you´re pratical appliance of things... that´s a plus, but the theory is WAAYYYY to easy to teach through a University degree!

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
which book to refer for this course

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I don't get it :\

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]because the point on the unit circle is given by (cos [angle] , sin [angle] ). Here, your angle is pi/4 . Which you probably know is square root of 2 over 2. But this is just simplified from 1 over the square root of 2, which is the point he has.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Great video! I love this series. In this lecture, Dr. Strang briefly mentions that the cost of operations for the det(A) will be (n!) He also shows us how the cost of getting A into upper triangular form U will be (1/3)n^3. But from Lecture 2 we know that one way of finding det(A) is to get A into U and then simply find the product of all n pivots. So it seems like the cost for finding det(A) would just be a bit more than (1/3)n^3, perhaps (1/3)n^3 + n. I must be missing something here; any thoughts?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
His lecture on "ways of looking at matrix multiplication" changed my life.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Me before watching this lecture: "Meh, elimination again. What possibly can I learn more about elimination? It's quite simple!"

Me after watching the lecture: "That. Is. Just. Amazing! Never thought about Matrix Multiplication this way before. Permutation Matrix was a great example to show elimination steps in Matrix form, and not only he did swapping rows but went on and showed us how swapping columns can only be done with right multiplication! This is amazingly mind refreshing. One can really save their mind from Alzheimer by only watching Prof. Strang's lectures :'D"

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Ahh dont you love when the teacher says "I am going to pick up this guy.." and the camera just zooms in to the point you CANT SEE WHAT THE "GUY" IS!!! ahhhhhhh so good bravo bravo.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished the whole 18.01 course. Thank you so much MIT for sharing such good educational resources for free!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This man is a great teacher!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You need a minimum of precalc. Students usually don't skip multi calc (though they can) because very very few highschools teach mv calc, though they offer an advanced standing exam to skip it if you learned however you did.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
49:14 friggin, this is why I hate math. Its too convenient how they make it so that they can get an answer. Maybe I am missing something.

multiplying and dividing(m&d) by 0 is illegal but limits cook up stuff by saying that we are not m&ding by 0 but by a very small "non-zero number"(non-zero being the key and hence the savior in this step). Ok, that makes sense. 

But right in the very next step, he plugs x to be x0 to make the second thing(or term if you want to call it that) zero. Like in one scenario (x-x0) is not a zero, but in another it is? Why is that fair?

Now it makes sense if that final answer is only an approximation. Meaning that the whole limit actually is not zero, but is very closer to zero. But in the case, does it mean that entire calculus' premise is based on approximation? And that if someone asks me what is the derivative of some function, would I be answering only an approximation?

Thank you Sir. This course was very much helpful for ML.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
cs


can you imagine this guy teaching trigonometry

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
anyone know how you would calculate the probability of x being greater than or equal to 1/2?

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Chalk ❤️

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Sir, you are the best. The way you think and ask questions during the lecture that really helps. I really enjoy your lecture and it really helped me to get my basics clear. I wish you a good health.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1-cosx just changes faster than x, when x -> 0, for example, how is the limit of n^2/n when n->0. Think about it.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Tested corona positive= 𝗣𝗔𝗡𝗜𝗞

After   33:15 = 𝗞𝗔𝗟𝗠

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
According to the course web site, lecture 8 is  the exam session, so I think there is no lecture 8.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I remember being a student and rushing out after class, as these students did. But now at the ripe age of 35, I see these students doing the same and I think "HOW DARE THEY NOT STOP AND APPLAUD FOR SUCH A MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE"

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
oh damn I circled the wrong thing...lol

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone watching from india ? 🤔

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Before the internet, we spent our days eating each others hair. Thanks, MIT and Professor Strang, for making these videos openly accessible. Learning online has really changed my life.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This man is amazing. I used to only be able to compute derivatives and limits, but this man made me understand the why and how of it as well.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i am 7 yr old,,, this is VRY EASY HAHAHAH

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
I've watched the first 6 videos without difficulty, but I'm confused by the definition and geometric meaning of different norms. Could anyone please tell me which textbook I should read to help me understand?  Thanks for your helping!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
He is really an excellent researcher, but not a good teacher. His explanation is going to make me crazy. I think for the newcomer these lectures are best:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OcoFcrLm0E

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the lecture is brilliant!

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
it's good to see in 1.25x speed

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"I try not to lie too much to you... but I do succeed." >:)

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To whoever is developing the courses online - Could u edit the video, right where Prof Auroux explains how to find the x and y limits for the triple integral int(dV)?
I understood the z limits but I didn't understand the logic for the x and y limits. If he could add a snippet explaining the limits with a diagram of columns and slices like he did for the double integrals, it would be better.
Thanks in advance and GREAT VIDEOS (though u must be tired of getting that sort of comment by now!)

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Damn, this guy rocks 🎸

Which b's allow the system of equations solved 19:39
Null space 28:12
Understand what's the point of a Vector space 40:24

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Absolutely great. If you have trouble getting this, maybe read a book first.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
"your lecturer is not rembrandt" HAHAHAH thanks for that

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
As much as I may find him to be an excellent teacher, and easy to understand, I cannot rule out that he is more difficult to understand if one has learned english as a second language. Regardless, closed captioning (click the triangle in the bottom right and then click the "cc" button) should remove any problems, yes?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is so helpful, the whole series. My professor can't teach his way out of a paper bag. I finally understand all of this! These videos are how I am passing my math class! Thank you!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
thats the problem with these programms! They have the better teachers not the better pupils!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you professor Strang💥...

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
((e^-3)/Squ.root(2))=0.035 which is approx. not equal to 1-3.5*1 at 39.09

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
19:50 why can't a line through the origin be orthogonal to a plane? It looks natural to me, that the z-axis is orthogonal to xy-plane

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
It's unfortunate that I use this video to help me fall asleep

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why don't they just use the ratio test to find the radius of convergence?

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
like it like it like it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"The natural log is the one that comes out naturally". Well, yeah, naturally. :D

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I learned a lot from his classes

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
how do you remember all those formulas? I am impressed.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Look what it says right next to the partial differential equations part. If you were hoping for lectures on PDEs, then this isn't the place. This lecture is a review of the material in the relevant unit.

### 4. Counting
Nice haircut professor

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
"can I show you the eigenvectors?" like an mit prof needs permission, lol. I love this guy

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
he looks so old than several years ago! I have got so many assists from him in linear algebra.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you don't understand professor explanation at 15:00 the angular velocity is 1 because v = wr and v is equal to r basically since r vector rotated 90 degree becomes v; so w = 1

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I hope the person controling the camera could have shown the 2 or 3 boards the professor were talking about, not just simply chasing the professor .....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
they make this stuff all seem so complicated in the way they teach it, its really simple stuff.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Marvellous explanations

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/ax-b-and-the-four-subspaces/factorization-into-a-lu/MIT18_06SCF11_Ses1.4sum.pdf lecture script here

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
It easy wth vietnamese students

### 34. Final Course Review
The world has  very few gem of a teacher like Dr.Prof Strang. Thanks for all the effort Prof Strang, I really cherished and appreciated all these 34 lectures.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
John Tsitsiklis is so great teacher!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
better then an Indian accent

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
Thanks again Dr Strang. For those of us coming from the ill posed problems world (a.k.a.Inverse Problems world)  this lecture is both gold and awesome. 
A million thanks

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
@[USERNAME]Thanks for the reply. It's just a confusing definition and if you google a bit on orthogonality, you find many other definitions contradicting this one. I think he should have pointed it out more clearly, but at least now I will be cautious when it comes to this topic. I guess that's good enough...

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
This guy is good!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Who Takes Calculus In Seventh Grade ? 
Better Yet , Who *Teaches* It ?

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Thanks so much for each lecture you provide us, I love your way of teaching. Wish that you live forever and enjoy teaching <3

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
long live MIT

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Think of the gaussian distribution...if you think this is easy you might be on the higher end of the curve and the questions you think were easy were targeted towards the average student...but because MIT is so selective their a the average for your xyz college will be much lower than that of MIT's for example my honors math at brown was way more challenging in a way too

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Most of the people don't   know that,Statistics is a subject of Science.🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 But we can't think any sectors that, where Statistics aren’t use.Thanks a lot for your explanation.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I don't understand. It should be 3 not 5 .  2*1=2 . 2-(-2)=4 . 4-1 = 3 ?  

Can someone help ?

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great lecture!

### 2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem
chinese teachers like to do the things that proceed without predefined variables before glance at audience and small smile thinking take that pupils . don't ask me how to know that because i am a chinese teacher too

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good Job Professor

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
why are they laughing when the boards move?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
“Forget the Associate name, not the law”, and, “I’ll let the author deal with that.”😉😉

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Most of the tuition pays for professors, the facility, other faculty, extracurricular programs, some programs don't get enough money. It's just like our government with taxes, they need more money to do the programs that are charitable. 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
My 💓 heart touching thanks to prof Gilbert Stang

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
+

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lecture along with the entire course and you yourself will always remain immortal Prof Strang. 
Thank you from almost the entire world who have benefitted from these golden amazing insightful flawless transitioned lectures. You are a mathematical genius. Hope you read this comment someday and realise you have the biggest Indian Fan.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
why sigma 1 is the largest singular value ? Why it's position relate to largest or not ? I dont understand

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Such a beatiful mind... Thank you so much!!! <3

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah this guy is great! 

great stuff... 
regards from australia!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Speaking of the plane intersection point, by extension, doesn't it mean a plane's an intersection of two 3-d spaces, and by further extension a 3-d space is an intersection of two 4-d spaces?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 5:49, I really liked the way of thinking dx, dy, dz as placeholders for putting values delta x, delta y, delta z in order to get tangent approximation for the function. The differential notation has been a fishy thing ever since I learned it but now it feels less so.

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy is an amazing lecturer. his videos have helped me out so much. i wish the camera man was a fraction as good as he is, though.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Love it when prof. Strang says "OKhay". Gives me a strange sense of satisfaction!

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
Before you get into this lecture, better review Tylor series.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lecture is particularly good.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
@[USERNAME]Dr. Strang can read minds too!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
16:31 "For any other rangle"?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I always thought econometrics taugh with sums was confusing. I finally found an intuitive way to understand least squares. The minimization  of errors proof is cool, but the simplicity of your proof combining the left nullspace,is awesome; thank you once again professor Strang.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
"Deep Cognition" is written on the blackboard behind Prof. Strang.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I want to cry happy tears.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a blackboard.....wow

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
29:00 30:00 
Plz someone tell me why is he taking -1 when going from P.Q
Same for P.R?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm just here to for the sound of chalk striking chalkboard.................

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He said he would cover differentiation for every single function. So can anyone tell me why I'm not seeing absolute values?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’m in highschool watching this and this is soo helpful. Thank you

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks to MIT and professor Strang. Is 18.06 is prerequisite to this course or it will be covered in this course?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
How to see that the two errors in the two pictures are equal? That is e1 = b - p, e2 = y - c - xd?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The law of cosine could be proved in several minutes, why he ask to believe in something instead of just give proof?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:45

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
52:15. "I'm gonna be stop by either the time runs out or the board runs out." Ha, Ha, Ha

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
43:00 - Summary

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the angular speed of the wheel was set to 1. That is it completed on revolution in 2pi units of time. The speed we calculated was the linear speed of a point on the wheel.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes but how is this useful to most people? Sure some people will use this,and some will every day, but why does someone who works as a truck driver, or a waiter,or a factory worker etc,etc need to know this? This math is only useful to a handful of people/jobs.Why does everyone have to learn this when most people will never once use this in the real world? Also,why are you so mad? I'm asking a simple question. I just think we should be learning more important things.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Fun fact, not mentioned in the video:

If the matrix A is singular, then the process is losing information because two linearly independent vectors in the input space could be mapped to the same output vector, making them indistinguishable. When the professor discussed the matrix for ordinary differentiation of a polynomial function, notice that it was singular. This corresponds to the arbitrary constant of integration i.e. information will be lost, so you save it ahead of time via initial conditions so you can reconstruct the input vector.

Linear algebra is amazing for this kind of insight.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Can someone wipe the blackboard for him?

### 16. Markov Chains I
how can i compute the probability of been at one point before other point, starting from any point. for exemple, been  in point 4 before the point 2 starting at any point?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Why is sin y considered equal to x as sin is equal to perpendicular/hypotenuse which should be equal to <x/sqrt(1+x^2)>
Am i confused or right
<y = 1/(cos y) = 1/(sqrt(1 - sin^2 y)) = 1/(sqrt(1 - x ^ 2))>

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
camera man is stupid

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
LOVE  YOU SIRRRRRR.................................................................

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
(y) excellent doc

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Delta modulation is a way to do the video compression from one image to the next that the professor was discussing. It only encodes changes in a signal. Electrical engineer here who does signal processing, linear algebra is so essential for such a task. These videos are extremely helpful.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
very organized lecture.thank you prof. Jerison

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow you fucking serious? dude im female and an electrical engineer. This was my first class freshman year. I would love to see you take the classes I'm taking right now

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
致敬！

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I really enjoy this lessons as they allow me to look at mathematics from a different angle. It's nice to see it in a slow paced way rather than studying it on a rush.


### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you !!! I finally completed this course!
This is really a long journey, with more than 34 lectures. I appreciate the elegance of linear algebra during this journey and I will never forget it.
Thank you, Professor Strang. Thank you, MIT OCW.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank You !!! Prof. Strang

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
@[USERNAME]I think this statistics is true. Because I don't think students need to watch again lecture they already have live in uni for second time. I think these videos in major for self learners or those who want to refresh their mind. I am 25 myself and I am not a student.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
can anyone provide me notes

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To all those saying that this is the best math instruction ever. I like this guy and find his explanations good and useful, but have had at least 4 professors that were better. I am very grateful for these videos, but don't think this is as good as it gets. this is just what competent math instruction looks like, not excellent math instruction. I hope you guys get to experience first hand really good instruction.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
18:19

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
thank you teacher

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
17:54 Considering Prof. Strang's art is teaching, he is undoubtedly one of the greatest in the world!

### 3. Independence
check how great is this lecturer. I am just from YEMEN>...
mit.edu/~jnt/home.html

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This course is excellent, so much needed in the modern world.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
i thought i've been taught linear algebra till i met this guy.

### 12. Iterated Expectations
thanks a lot

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
beautiful

### 34. Final Course Review
It's been a pleasure, Professor Strang. Thank you.

### 8. Undecidability
ello sir youre very smart

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where did M(2) come from?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Is he just  making this up?I have no idea what he is talking about,  or why he is talking about it

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Amazing lesson ♥♥

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy is great!!!

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Integration using the Reduction Formula starts at 27:45

### 6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis
At 42:10, why is Zigma * used in simulating M, can't we just directly use A to do it?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mind blowing!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The point of learning this in high school is to get a early start.  Calculus in high school is not the same as calculus in college (as I learned the hard way).  The work is harder, workload is harder, tests are 10x harder.  Teacher doesn't spend a whole lot of time on things you don't understand.  Don't understand it?  Go back to your room and read.
You learn some of this in high school so you won't get a F in college.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I won't understand people who disliked this videos. I haven't liked revisiting a topic, unless it is from Deep Learning. But this! This is a gem that I will revisit my entire life, any given day. 

Bored? Pick a topic from this series.
Depressed? Pick a topic from this series.
Need inspiration? Pick a topic from this series.
Time on your hands? Still need a hint?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I can't explain in the words that how much your lectures have changed the way I study. I hope to see you one day and thank personally.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
This is the best lecture series of Linear algebra ❤️

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
As easy as abc

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The geometric approach to calculus is so helpful in understanding all sorts of concepts. 

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The thing to remember the right hand rule was quite funny,and reminded me of the one I personally use: be A the axis and B tangent to the rotation that'd happen in A, then it'll work like a screw, going forward when clockwise and backward when counterclockwise...

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
"the more theta hat moves with theta the more uncertainty it removes from theta's..." wow

### 3. Independence
16:35 - why is it not intuitive that if P(A) = 0, then A is independent with any other event?
If the probability of it's raining on Mars is 0, then is it still 0 even if any other event happened.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]How is that necessary for education?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you, Professor.  You are remarkable at what you do and being able to watch your lectures is an honor.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The students are pretty observant too and ask good questions.Well done ✅

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
He looks like Richard Dawkins

### 9. Reducibility
At 1:01:55 on checkin 9.5, I'd like to give you guys a intuition on why it is true.
It's true because if you look at the definition of a T - recognizer, it says -:
1. Halts and accepts
2. Halts and rejects
3. Loops and rejects
Now,
Let A be T - recognizable and O be it's recognizer.
Suppose w is a string not in A.
Now, when you look  Ā and it's recognizer Ō( Ō is implemented using O, it does opposite of what O does) and pass w through it, it should accept w, but since you're implementing Ō with the help of O, it loops on w and rejects it.
Therefore it's not always possible for Ā to be recognizable if A is. Infact it's possible on a special condition, which is A must be a decidable language.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
Can someone help me understand how the pseudoinverse conclusion at 37:52 is reached?

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Followed all the way until the IRLS method... a bit too much for my brain capacity for now but will challenge sometime later

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Could someone help me understand "where does the 2 by 2 matrix inverse formula come from?" 1:33 I don't think this formula was taught previously. In my memory, only the Gauss-jordan method were taught to get inverse of a matrix.Thank youuu!

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
Very thanks MIT for sharing such a knowledge

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
As someone who has studied mathematics for 40 years and taught mathematics for 30 years, I can say that Professor Strang's wisdom and insight is amazing. Moreover, his ability to share this insight with enthusiasm (however quirky and geeky) is a gift to all of us. Thank you Sir. Bless all those dedicated to teaching.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Thank you!! These lectures are so clarifying and ease to watch!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
You can get the slides if you go to the link in the description (and read the missing part in this video).
Excelent lecture,it took me 3 days to understand all the concepts exposed.
At 55:23 is not equal to alpha, is equal to (1- alpha) since that is the way he defined the q (you can see that in the slides).

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
This is pure gold... such a fantastic Professor!! Thank you

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very enjoyable lectures. Prof. Auroux is a great teacher.

to much teacher centered

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If my teachers would have asked , any questions 
I wouldn't have come here . 
excellent teacher !!

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor's face when people were coming in late pained me 😥

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
21:53 How most textbooks use the term "obvious."

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, zero dislikes as of now!!!!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Could anyone explain why solving A_T A  x_hat = A_T b is equivalent to using calculus? Specially how does the least square error fit in the first method?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
LOL at taking a vote on the sum formula of sine

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Why is dim S = 6   ?

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Hawkings radiation compels us to go in for Blackhole as singularity becomes unsteady flow for a vaporisation in a way supports Einstein's refusal to accept Blackhole as singularity.

### 15. Poisson Process II
It's a pleasure to listen to you Sir !! I am studying at an IIT

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Useful

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]Because e^(6it) = cos(6t)+i sin(6t), which always has a modulus of 1.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
thank a lot

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Interesring the Math on MIT. Greattings from México

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Interesting observation of human behaviour that the first lecture in this series has >1mill views and now we are <100k

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Stats are like bikinis, what the reveal is very tantalizing but what they conceal is vital.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent videos:) but in the end doesn't he say "if you multiply u1,u2,u3 by this you get x1,x2,x3" because on the transcript its switched.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Great lecture

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
38:35 pilot in class

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
TILL NOW. In college senior year. I had never known that elementary transformations were just multiplying matrices on both sides of Ax = b 🤦🏻‍♂️

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
E

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Can I become pretty good at probability after attending all the lectures of this course?

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
By far the best explanation of chi squared distribution in the last two lectures I've seen anywhere. How come lecture 10 is not available?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]that's what she said. . .

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish more people knew MIT did such a thing.
Thanks Professor Jerison and Muller. It's been an honour to learn from you.
India, 2022.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
30:28 xD

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]when you do the row exchange, do you need to do the row exchange in the vector x solution ?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
*circuitous but not circular*

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Professor Strang mentions that U and V form bases for the four fundamental subspaces of A, but it's not clear to me how C(A) = C(Ur) and C(A') = C (Vr'). I know that U and V were determined by the eigenvectors of AA' and A'A, respectively, but how are these related to the column and row spaces of A?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I wish I would have watched this videos back in my Engineering. No problem I will watch it now though I am 26 now.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This is Calc 2. Your argument is invalid. ocw (dot) mit (dot) edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
For those of you who can properly understand this course, what basis courses have you taken? I'm a computer science major and I cannot quite follow the maths here.

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He is excited about questions. That's awesome..

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
The camera person was really defocused that day.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I only hope that when I move to MIT next month, I learn as much from lectures in person as I can from watching them on youtube. This was great, I've decided that learning more math is a good way to kill some time this summer =)

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
but if the input nodes count in NN is lower than num. of  outputs then the forward mode changes to backprop from the other side, I mean if you compute Jacobians and use them in successive computations in the right order, is that so?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]from normal we can find equation of the plane

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what happened at 7:09???

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India
http://www.wellesleypublishers.com/buy.html

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
35:08 I think this will still work as long as f/g tends to a non-zero finite number. Is this correct?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1 minute in and I'm bored fuck this..math is lame.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Even Gilbert Strang doesn't tell us where the determinant formula comes from... Really sad... Properties 1-3 are also deducible from that formula.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
If the line lies in the plane, then is their union a subspace

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT 

### 16. Markov Chains I
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm 1 year old and I learned that 2 years ago...hehehe! bastards

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I think for 2 and 3 way of matrix multiplication there should be change.Rows of C are combinations of rows of A and columns of C are combinations columns of B.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much to professor Jerison and the MIT team for creating this whole course. I'm starting my journey in Calculus and it is way easier and more appealing because of you.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
the derivative is linear thing blew my mind

### 18. Properties of Determinants
대박!!


### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
same content as my non ivy league university. in fact because the professor is so good here and i had to teach my self everything i would say it was harder.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
The bit at 4:54 where b is replaced by Ax giving A(A^TA)ˉ¹ATAx, which then collapses to Ax is fantastic. It's so high-level and so simple to see.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
you guys betterate the video. cool

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Could you please upload the notes to the new community section of mit

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
My right ear learned a lot

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
why someone is interested to change columns?? it doesnt make sense to me.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
since the rectangles are squared ( which proved by the professor about the reverse power rule but on squared - i think - ) ,thus if you raise to cube then the graph will be 3 dimensional, so if the higher the nth power the higher the dimensions??? i thought of it cause of how he relates the pyramid and the rectangles with the square 


edit: well.. ok he didnt relate it but thats how i think of it

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The G(n-1) function IS the integral of x^(n-1)*e^x.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
great lecture thanks again mit

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm upset to see all the likes, I always liked trig substitution. It preserves the domain, changes at the same rate, and breaks open radicals. It's pretty darn elegant and powerful too

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I think Strang leaves out a key point in the difference equation example, which is that the n unique eigenvectors form a basis for R^n, which is why u0 can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What do you mean you don't know how to integrate it??

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Who more felt hurt when saw him really old

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
The legend! Thank you!

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To check the vector field is conservative, compute the cul of the vector field and see if it  is zero .I think it is easier.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great prof! Wish I found this sooner, my mutivariable woes would've been dispelled

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
9:00 “you get an A in the course now” i hope the student got an A

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Awesome video! Thank you!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Gauss-Jordan, a genius method!

### 15. Poisson Process II
Great lecture, thank you.  Will help me with my Stochastic Processes course

### 18. PSPACE-Completeness
The proof contents of the previous lecture and this lecture is breathtakingly amazing!

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Good time!

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
46:46 "he had m=2, but we should yeah grow up and get m to be 5 dimensional"  lol this guy is so funny :)

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone who tries to attempt the double integeral by hand at 13:23. Remember when switching to polar coordinates dA is r drdθ and x=2+cosθ because r=1 and center of circle is at (2,0). Aso it's really weird at first since you try to calculate the area of a circle on shifted x and you think that the area of the circle remains the same since the radius is the same. You would think Α=πr^2 no matter what x is but no. The area of the circle depends on the center (x,y) because of the force field.

### 8. Undecidability
"Somebody got it. It's i^ith power. let's not get hung up on that please."
literally half a second later:
"i^ith oddly enough can be seen as a real number if you define the imaginary exponentiation, which is weird."

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How i find the homework of this course ?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
To him, beasts are little mice..conceptually and symbolically ..wau wau

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
i always forget how big an assumption iid is.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
The unsightly newsprint pivotally deserve because discovery additonally precede at a ill battle. abortive, nifty skill

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I appreciate the brief discussion of the philosophical implications of Bayes' rule at the end, it's very interesting to know.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do we have to take the derivative of the area?
What does that mean in this case?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The father of "Maths..." I like all your lectures very much!!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Best maths teacher ever in my life , respect sir. Love from India ♥️

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank You Prof. Strang for making this available for free

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone explain the applause?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love MIT, I feel moore conected with them than my own university. You have a place in my hart!


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone please tell us why we are stuck using (*) at 26:32 to find the value of y? If I substitute 2 for x, y^2 will have 2 values, 0.73205 and -2.73205. We can discard -2.73205 as that t=will give imaginary values for y. Can someone please tell me where I am going wrong? 
Many thanks in advance.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
25:25 Does Positive Definite and Projection Matrices require eigenvectors to be orthogonal? Thank you.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture! Took me a moment to process r x v = constant. I have always thought of Kepler's 2nd as 'equal area in equal time' but that translates to 'proportional to time'

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
1:24 crowded class

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Gil Strang is a legend. I learned so much from him even though I never set foot on MIT's campus. Glad to see him still active after all these years.

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
He basically can write with the eraser instead!

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why slope is 2?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
i love how the end of this lecture just turns into a bill clinton roast

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
You are the god of Maths.Thank you for making such videos. Most maths teachers know maths but they dont know how to teach maths.You teach in such a way which could be understood by even a high school student.thanks a lot

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It seems that this course is a combination of what is usually separated into two courses typically named "Calculus 1" and "Calculus 2". Is that correct?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow. im in 8th grade and i got this (well how to solve the first segment on vectors). and i was just looking at this video for kicks. and THOSE idiots got into MIT!!??

### 25. Classical Inference III
fuck this course was long af, made it

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
25:35 Ok boomer to Cramer.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Waait a sec, this is college mathematics in America? 

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is best Linear Algebra Course one can find on the internet

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
i aspire to be his level in atleast one subject

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
35:17 The lovely sound of science

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
what's the program he's using for plotting the functions??

### 3. Independence
I love the trees and recursive nature of the multiplication rule

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
hahahahaha xD , hilareous lecture , <3

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
better to watch the Khan Academy statistics playlist before MIT18.650

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ 11:45 How is f-double prime of x(0) equals to c & not to zero ???

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
So this is Independence Day.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
@[USERNAME]Given full rank (r = n) and m<=n, does that implies r can be larger than m?

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
great lecture!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wait...why is a topic that requires L'Hôpital's Rule to prove...
...being used as a "foundational" principle?!

I'm all for --integrating-- incorporating transcendental functions early, but this is a bit absurd.
WHY?!?!?!?

*edit:* "Integrating" was a poor choice of descriptor (obviously)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Taking a break from elden ring to learn something that will help me not die

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
do i make sth wrong when i still dont have that at school with the age of 17?

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Thanks Prof. Strang!!! This lecture is a work of art. I was doing some work on a DFT course and needed a comprehensive approach to DFT/IDFT, Best 50 minutes I have spent. Thanks for the tip on Hermitian and unitary matrices!!! 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Anyone know someone this good at explaining probability theory?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
2019.10.29. 16:57

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I actually enjoyed the lectures by professor Miler much more than the lectures by professor Jerison.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lectures. By the way, the students are so easily amused.🤣🤣

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
How I would wish to stay at MIT studying right now

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
The combination of lecture 14 and 15 are works of art, things of beauty. 

Thank you MIT. Thank you professor Strang.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think his most exceptional ability is to understand the questions that people ask him. I don't think I have seen him misunderstand one question.  I have seen a lot of good lecturers, but not all of them are good at understanding the questions they are asked. Logically, he would be an even better lecture if he encouraged even more questions. I also like that he does not try and put on a show but gets to the point.  A weak point. i wish he would motivate his topics upfront with concrete examples

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
can someone explain to me the hat problem? esp for the variance. thx so much!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow this lecture is really dense

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think 19 people didn't understand this lecture =) 
Nice vid  btw 

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow. I wish I had him when I was taking this stuff 10 yrs ago.Thank you Dr. whoever you are.Thanks MIT!


### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Has any encountered viewing problems with the video?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this is really neat :)

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That exchange with the student between 15-20 min was because Jerison wrote "right hand limit" but really meant "the limit on the right hand side of the equation". The student (and probably most of the other students) thought he meant "the limit as x approaches a from the positive direction", which is what people usually mean by "right-hand limit".

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you for this beautiful lecture Sir!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I high-key thought it was hella cool when he added the two loops together on the picture, subsequently adding the two basis vectors for N(A)^T and creating a dependent vector. 
I was kind of expecting that to happen just theoretically, but to actually see it happen just blew my puny mind.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
CX

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why is this being taught at MIT, I feel as if you attend that school you should at least have a grasp on FTC. Great video though! Thanks MIT

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
so what?...

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
This is mind blowing. Great lecture.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
but the rest the lecture is pretty good!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He has a french name "Denis Auroux" and also a french accent so i guess he's certainly from france.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Love you sir. Hats off.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Ok, this is kinda weird, but I love the lady's speaking voice. It just sounds so... peaceful? calm?

idk but I feel relaxed somehow

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thanks for the videos! Any lecture on econometrics?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Randomness is a big rug under which we sweep everything that we don't understand; and we hope that, on an average, we've captured the effect of what's going on. Leap of faith: We don't know whether we are correct of doing this - Maybe we have made systematic biases by doing this.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
i never go to school thanks to and get to have way better lecture thanks to mit and the professors there.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Super high watching these, very relaxing and informative.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lol, this is easy.
I'm going to Uni this year and was super nervous that I wasn't going to be able to manage the maths. I can sleep calmly now :)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
love him so much!!!!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you sir,
Gr from Holland

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Since 10:40 Professor changed the notation, right? I think he swaps the notation of g(.) and b(.).

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
11:14

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Wow. Nice explanations. Thank u MIT.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
If Philippe speaks too quickly for you don't forget you can slow down the speed in the settings.  I found 0.75 worked for me.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Prof Strang is a blessing to humanity!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
我是中国人 很感谢🙏

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
@[USERNAME]
Yes thanks a lot Prof. Strang, I had the same problem than you , the more I tried to know the difference the more I got confused, but this video really made me undestand, thanks so much !

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Hello it is not about what you use. It is about how you use it or what you do with it. Mr. White board there are many with one. You will be able to distinguish the difference. Indeed that is the choice of the Professor well you could choose to teach with what you feel is more appropriate.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
The reason I went from hating math to loving math (especially linear algebra) is Gilbert Strang. What an incredible teacher.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
DR. Strang thank you for a powerful lecture on the Survey of Difficulties with Ax=b. In linear systems this equation is displayed in many technical books, with little or no thought about it's difficulties. From watching this lecture, the difficulties of this equation is explained in great detail.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
So he's saying we can email him our homework problems?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Terrific, terrific lecture, esp his way of using linear combination / "column picture" to solve equations. I have never heard of it, but it is so much easier! 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
WHAT A LEGEND

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Does anyone tell me the material URL used in this lecture?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
(21:29) "So, anytime I multiply cofactors by some numbers, I'm getting the determinant of *_something_* " - Important point in this lecture!!   
And (14:16) also the same idea("...determinant of *_some_* matrix...").

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Made it here from Lec 1. Very satisfied

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you, so, so much!

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
What if he realises I’m not registered for his class , I won’t be allowed to watch this video

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
that is very satisfying sounding chalk

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Very good!!!


### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
As an electronic engineer I absolutely loved this class, just amazing!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
that the most convoluted explanation for what "e" is. I now feel like i don't understand it.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Around 34:00 : what about the case there AC - B^2 > 0 but A = 0? I take it that is also a case where we have a local max, since -B^2 is always negative; i'm just sorta surprised no-one noticed the omission?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
String theory

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good luck! I was in your position once! I didn't get into MIT, but I was accepted into Stanford.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I am from India .
 American Maths is too easy...I am in Ninth and I have studied this chapter its to easy...The questions sir written on the board were to easy to calculate..😂😂😂

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
@[USERNAME]The fact that A^T * A and A * A^T have the same non-zero eigenvalues is blowing my mind right now. I guess this is intimately related to the fact that det(B) = det(B^T), since det is where we get the characteristic polynomial/egenvalues...

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
25:24 To prove AB and BA share the same eigenvalues, I think here the proof only proves the case when B is invertible. So this is not a general proof.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Maybe it'll get harder later on?

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how are we supposed to get into mit?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
8 people got a F- in this class

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'm confused, why are there so many students in this class? aren't most MIT students going in with a bunch of AP courses under their belt. surely, ap calculus is one of them .

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
4:42 A multiply x, matrix A times vector x, how to look at that, think of the *rows* , combination of the vectors
8:56 column space of A,  C(A)
18:31 C: the basis of A's column space
20:00 the column rank of A
20:22  A= C times R,  factoring
23:49  column rank = row rank

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Thanks so much Prof Gilbert Strang, I wasn't understanding Determinant usage, and now I fully understand owing to the proprieties, which makes it so simple. you have just a gifted skill to teach so well and clear, before answering the questions, putting the shoes of a student, to think of a possible solution and applying what u have just teach, and applying to problem solving instead of mechanizing meaningless math rules.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This lecture is closed under any other lectures!

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
His explanations on the normally convolutedly explained Markov Inequality, Chebyshev's Inequality, heck, even convergence of limit, are spotless! Such a gem. Thank you MIT, thank you Prof.Tsitsiklis.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hi there,

I think MIT's answer was clear enough; their goals are not your goals. They work to educate ALL students - those that can and those that can't afford it.

I fail to see what this has to do with anybody's eaten flesh. And developing international academic standards helps to increase competition which is beneficial to the international body of knowledge. It increases global standards which leads to more motivation to you know, work hard, and stay relevant. It's good for mankind.

16:30 the free variable, rank, and special solution amount relation

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you Professor Denis Auroux and MIT. 
Just now completed the 18.02, (18 August, 2022).
Single variable calculus - Prof. David Jerison
Multivariable calculus - Prof. Denis Auroux.

Thanks again !

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Ok, you are easily amused"


I know right?

### 3. Independence
John Tsitsiklis is awesome !
Clear explanation, no philosophical mumbles. 
Plain old school scholar which I like very much !  Conveying idea via paper and pencil these days is rare and should be treasured !

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
It is human to make an error.
It takes a computer to screw things!

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Do you study maxwell's equations?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
@[USERNAME]The third row in the matrix says that 0 = b3 - b2 - b1, so the values for b1, b2 and b3 must satisfy the result 0.
And the numbers 1, 5 and 6 for b1, b2 and b3 are good because they turn the equation 0 = b3 - b2 - b1 into 0 = 6 - 5 - 1, which is true.

There is an infinite number of other possible solutions as well --- for example, you could choose b1, b2 and b3 to be 50, 100 and 150, and in that case you would get 0 = 150 - 100 - 50, which is also true.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Notes for future ref.)
(7:16) there are _some_ matrices that do _NOT_ have n-independent eigenvectors, but _most_ of the matrices we deal with do have n-independent eigenvectors.
(17:14) If all evalues are different, there _must_ be n-indep evectors. But if there are same evalues, it's possible _no_ n-indep evectors. (Identity matrix is an example of having the same evalues but still having n-indep evectors)
* Also, the position of Lambda and S should be changed(32:36). You'll see why by just thinking matrix multiplication, and it can also be viewed by knowing A^100=S*Lambda^100*S^-1 and u_0=S*c.
 Thus, it should be S*Lambda^100*c, and this also can be thought of as 'transformation' between the two different bases - one of the two is the set of the egenvectors of A.
* Also, (43:34) How prof. Strang could calculate that?? Actually that number _1.618033988749894..._ is called the 'golden ratio'.
* (8:15) Note that A and Lambda are 'similar'. (And, S and S_-1(S inverse) transforms the coordinates.. you know what I mean.. both A and Lambda can be though of as some "transformation" based on different basis.. and S(or S_-1) transforms the coord between those two world.)

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks so much, Professor Strang!

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
23:30  ".... including slightly more legit businesses like insurance", lmao!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I have never seen Professor Strang simplicity and humility to explain complex concepts in other person. I still remember a summer when I took an accelerated course at the University, I remember I was not able to understand even a word from the professor giving the course at that time, so, I remember went back home totally upset, and I saw the first Linear Algebra video of the Professor Strang, and I spent the whole week watching the full Linear Algebra course videos, and that summer, I approved Linear Algebra with a 9, completing the exam in record time, avoiding complex resolution steps explained by the current professor giving the course, and applying the simplicity Professor Strang transmitted on his lectures. And the most important thing was that I learnt a lot, everything was looking super clear for me at the time of reading the exercises in the exam. Absolutely brilliant, humble, and simple, as everything in life has to be. Thank you Professor!!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
sure :)

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
As a German I'm obliged to note that: "Eigen" is a German word and means "own" or "selv".

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Imagine this guy breaking bad ..

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
Man, I love professsor Strang, but his brain was not working very well during this lecture.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
5:43 close enough
HE KNOWS MEMEBASE! GASP!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
looks  like right hnded rubixs alg

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
There was nothing new that I had learned by watching this, although I did enjoy it very much. The only thing that I noticed about the section that pertains to the dot product that wasn't mentioned but I feel is just as significant is that it doesn't just check for orthogonality whether two vectors are perpendicular or not, but that it also tests if two vectors either coincide or are parallel! They are parallel or coincide when the dot product yields (-1). This is simply because theta will equal either +/- 180 degrees or +/- PI radians where cos(+/- 180) or cos(+/- PI)  yields (-1) because the cosine is an even function.

I had horrible experiences with learning math in elementary school and since then, I've had a negative predisposition to it. This playlist is reversing that predisposition.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
By the chain rule, (d/dx) f(g) when g is a function of x is g' * f '(g).
In this case, the "g" is (kx) so you can get the answer by using the chain rule.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
These are too good. I spent days reading abstract definitions and formal explanations in books to understand concepts this professor explains so vividly and creatively with 10 seconds! Thank you!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
When deriving the normal equation AT * A * x_bar = AT * b, I struggle to understand why I cannot simply divide both sides by AT, leaving me with A * x_bar = b, which is wrong. Solving for x_bar and plugging it back into p = A * x_bar just seems to circular of an argument. Can someone help me understand? :)

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's employed in all the physics that go into making pretty much any electronic device, including the one that you use to spread your stupidity. Without calculus, you'd be stupid AND lonely.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
46:19  Professor Strange lets his anger out on the class

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've yet to take Calculus, many people make it out to be the achilles heel of those who seek higher learning. I hope that's not the truth.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
If w is constant, how can its gradient vector point toward higher values?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This guy is good to a great extent but I like somebody like Eddie Woo who looks for feedback from students and has more of a personality.    He should occasionally take questions which he does not. Often times he is looking at the floor.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I'm taking this course at IU using the book Dr. Strang wrote and this is extremely helpful

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I had linear algebra over 40 years ago, but this was the first time I'd seen it presented this way.  I've done fine in my engineering career, but this kind of thinking would have definitely made a few things easier.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Brilliant example. 30:55

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
On our faculty they didn't tell us anything about  3-diagonal. GREAT video and thx for the lecture.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone understand the symmetry thing he was talking about? Which equation did he stare at XD

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I also found [-2,2,-2,1] seems to produce a zero vector and it is not a multiple of the special solutions [-2,1,0,0] or [2,0,-2,1]. Can someone help me understand why [-2,2,-2,1]  also produces a solution? Is it because column #1 and column #2 are dependent?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think he made a mistake on A+B before 26:23 because I'm not quite sure but as what I saw, he formed a rectangle that has  length A and width B, however he said that A+B is the Diagonal of this rectangle, but theoretically speaking all diagonals of a rectangle is the square root of the sum of the squared length and squared width. right?and before the video hits 23:33 I see couple of students asking the question that I should have asked. But NO ONE IS PERFECT. so please be kind to him.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
talking about splitting hairs, at 20:10 he states that the sample space is infinite. but he must be talking about impossibly small darts. all real objects are confined within the limits of plank space and plank increments. although the number is very large, there is actually a finite number of real spaces that a real dart could land on within that square. the plank units are what stops infinite regression within a limited area of space in actual real world applications. only in thought experiments can you have points that are smaller than plank units of size.

### 16. Markov Chains I
Brilliant Job done here ....

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
These lectures are awsome. Strang makes Linear Algebra seem so easy - completely oppisite of his "colleagues" at my university. I've stopped attending their lectures in favour of these. Thanks MIT (W. Gilbert Strang)!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Awesome!!!

### 34. Final Course Review

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is night and day to my professor. So much simple insight I didn't glean like the simple fact: to swap columns, put the elementary matrix on the right. Wow. I didn't get this until now, I would always try to transpose in a roundabout way.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why are these videos plagued by bot comments.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wait why did delta v turn to zero ?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I learned more about determinants within the first 5 minutes of this video than I did 
in my 3 hours of lectures on the topic so far.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
In the concluding "review" he reminds us that initial state vector u₀ must be decomposed into eigenvectors. However, he seems refused to say that the eigenvector will look like exponential function [1 λ λ² λ³ ] of eigenvalues λ, http://valjok.blogspot.com/2013/12/eigenvectors-of-recurrence-equations.html. In case you start evolving from y₀ !=1, instead of [y₀ y₁ y₂ y₃  …] = [1 λ λ² λ³], your recursive process evolves through the state variables [y₀ y₀λ y₀λ² y₀λ³ ]. Yet, y₀ is unimportant as long as eigenvector is concerned. Only eigenvalues λ are important. It is cool that [1 λ λ² λ³] is the exponential vector and since exponents must be the solutions of linear differential equations. I just do not understand how why does he explain how our recursion evolves u₀ → u₁ → … (the initial value problem) if our goal is to find all solutions, regardless of what are the boundary conditions.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This is very good.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
I think Prof. Strand made a little mistake in calculating the variance at 35:00, both terms should be further divided by an "S"(the sample size), and the final variance should have 1/S in front. Besides, the variance of N IID variables should be 1/N of the indiviual IID variable.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
"blackboard extends to infinity..." yeah, MIT does have infinitely long blackboard...

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture and professor!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For the pumpkin example, at t=4 and h=0, why isn't the instantaneous velocity 0? Wouldn't v=-40m/s at t=~3.999999 or h=~0.000001 but at impact point v=0 since pumpkin transitions from -40m/s to 0m/s when it collides with the ground?

### 12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue
There is something I cannot understand when prove Alon-Boppana bound.
1:01:38
|V_i| w_i (w_{i-1} + (d-1)w_{i+1}) is bad for i=0 since the unique vertex v in V_0 does not have a predecessor. (It must be |V_0| w_0 d w_1.)
w_{-1} = (d-1)^{1/2} and |V_0| w_0 = 1 and |V_i| w_i^2 <= 1, so I think that this gap may not be negligible.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How come e^[lim n->ග ln(1+1/n)^n] = e^1... well i thought it will be e^0 because (1+1/n)^n will be eventually reach 1 as n approach infinity and ln(1) is just 0 so i thought it must be e^0

e-2 is correct. (-e+2e-0-2) = e-2 and the other calculations are correct

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
40:01 how did he get the projection matrix? what is the a??

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Thank you, this is so helpful

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Finally a real analysis video lecture series from the OCW :'). Thank you

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The example on 16:14, I think (-2)/(x+2)^3 the power to the 3 should be 4, since you use quotient rule solve the next derivative.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Uve gotta love him!!!<3!!hehe!!!!!Very well explained lecture.....

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What's with the weird comments here?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I used to think Princeton's cal 3 is better but this guy is actually the best I've seen.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Awesome

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would like to ask about the example with kepler's law.
Professor considers radius r as constant, but the object is moving around elliptical trajectory, so radius varies as function of theta. Have I missed something, or has he made an error?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
It's like an enlightenment moment when he says, "she said, it's got two identical rows"

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
He is French isn't he?

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am loving mathematics now... which makes life easier at NIT


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
33:01 after watching the 3blue1brown serie and being on this video on this serie I'm a huge fan of columns, and find they make much more sense than rows.
If you want to understand the geometrical meaning of linear algebra I recommend everyone to watch the 3blue1brown playlist, everything you use on linear algebra has a geometrical equivalent, why matrices that have determinant equal to 0 doesn't have an inverse, how linear transformations (matrices) modify space, how the basis vectors generates the space, how the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which the area of something in that space changes, and so forth.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
He reminds me of Jimmy Stewart.  Very unassuming.  Makes out as though he's figuring it out as he goes along, but of course he wrote the book.  Zen master at work!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is an awesome lecture. I just had a little bit of confusion at the first of the lecture, when Prof. Strang was talking about the four ways to do Matrix Multiplication. How are they all connected? I couldn't get it very well, and there weren't examples on this particular point.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Feel like I'm watching an episode of Seinfeld with that laugh track, great set of lectures tho

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This real professor taught me a lecture that our "fake professor" couldn't teach for weeks. I hate to say that woman is a professor, it is just rudeness to this man. Thanks TEACHER.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
This comment section is so surprisingly positive... almost makes me suspicious :,D

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Such a great teacher you are Prof. Thank you so much for every moment you spent teaching...

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The best ever way to teach Jacobians, wow greatest of the great, Jacobians .......great, the professor explanation ...great

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
sad. the formal definition of the saddle point isnt given...and where is the proof that the difference of two linear functions squared always yields a saddle?

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
12:10 very good explanations on what a link function does

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
how is 4ac-b^2 a square term? and how is that in the third case if a<0 it is max and a>0 it is min

### 4. Counting
Lecturers with dry humor are the best

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Lovely!

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Such a great professor. Calc made simple.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
Perfect explanation， thanks

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof, I have watch this through lec 1. I have to say, you are awesome. Thank you so much for teaching. I wish I could be your student in your class. So jealous the guys in class applause for your super erasing. 

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Arrr, finally I found a key to understand multivariables! My lecturer is just screwing it up! I couldn't understand it even I study by myself. Is worth a waste of 46 minutes on watching this recording!


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what book is he using?


### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I also love this series of lectures, but in this lecture I find that he does not explain perpendicular subspaces enough. The example with the blackboard and the floor is just confusing (to me and my colleagues at least), because obviously they form a right angle and thus are perpendicular. And obviously they are both subspaces. Which leads me to believe that the definition is wrong, which I'm sure it isn't.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
This lecture and the one before are some of the hardest in the whole course. Stay the course, everyone.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the lecturer somehow reminds me of harryson wells from the flash

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Very well explained. Really big fan of prof.John Tsitsiklis

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I know. It's weird how these are already intelligent students that got in, yet they have professors that are millions time easier to comprehend and a lot more attentive of their students than at most other universities! Anyways i love these videos they sure do help a lot!

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of the best online courses I have seen - he is such a good lecturer, so clear and concise.

wow.Thanks.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
For the last example why did we not convert the matrix to reduced row form.....and then find the pivot column? Find converting column 2 and 4 are the free column......

### 4. Counting
In 38:30 , I didn't understand how elements inside B are equally likely if elements inside sample space are not. 
Even if B occurred, how elements of B become equally likely?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I believe that guy is troll. My advice is, next time you see something as stupid as that just laugh to yourself and play another of those excellent videos.
:-)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
These lectures should be stored properly so that whenever aliens do come, they can learn linear algebra the right way.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

new approach of learning ....😍😍

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
A true gift to the world

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Thm. A vector is orthogonal to itself if and only if it is the zero vector.
Proof. Backwards. Suppose there exists a vector x s.t. that is orthogonal to itself has a nonzero entry. Then xTx=summation xixi>=bi^2. Analog holds for negative bi. Which contradicts there existing a vector with nonzero entries which has a zero dot product.
Forward. Trivial.
Then Ax=0 If A has independent columns ie. is of full rank, then the only vector in the N(A)=[0].

a)P(A) < P(B)
b)P(B)≥P(A)
c)P(A) = P(B)
d)P(A)≥P(B)

Correct answer of this question ? Please tell

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you're actually being serious, you're seriously lacking insight, hahahahaha!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank you

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
S contains a bunch of numbers independent of t (the eigenvectors), so d/dt and S would commute.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
@[USERNAME]I had the opposite reaction. 7 was a fortunate choice (or maybe he really chose it on purpose). The point of the demonstration is the ideas behind Guass-Jordan. There's no reason to make the calculations messier than they need to be.

12:12 - well said, accurately diagnosed one of humans' 'weaknesses', sloppiness. It is the source of many societal problems.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
So happy to see Professor Strang still teaching beautifully. Even more happy that he’s mentioned Julia already in lecture 1. Thank you MIT for providing such up to date material.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
21:55 My brain stopped working when he drew ℝ4 on 2 dim board! Woah!!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I have no doubt his explanation is excellent, but as someone who was not taught by an excellent teacher prior to viewing this video, I was somewhat confused. Honestly, most of the students in this class appear to have already had linear algebra multiple times. Many of these conclusions they come to naturally require extensive underlying knowledge.

I came to comments section to see what doubts people have discussed. The only thin I see are funny jokes. LOL

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I love Prof. Strang and he is awesome. So, I will try to slow this lecture down. 
If you copy the following text into a mathjax friendly interface, you can read all the equations properly.


The basic knowledge we need from calculus is $\frac{d}{dt}$$e^{ax} = ae^{ax}$. Now we have two equations $$\frac{du_1}{dt} = -u_1+2u_2$$ $$\frac{du_1}{dt} = u_1-2u_2$$ I write these equations as $$\begin{matrix} u_1'\\u_2' \end{matrix} = \biggl[\begin{matrix} -1&2\\1&-2 \end{matrix}\biggr] \begin{matrix}u_1\\u_2\end{matrix}$$.

In matrix form, $U' = AU$. Now if I take $e^{\lambda t}k$ where 'k' is a vector as a solution, I get $\lambda e^{\lambda t}k = Ae^{\lambda t}k $, which is $Ak = \lambda k$. Hence lambda gives the power of the exponential in the solution which multiplies an eigenvector k. 

Part two (after minute 29): We already know that a complete set of eigenvectors will form a basis. So we can use eigenvector matrix to write any column vector. Then $u=Sv$; $\frac{du}{dt} = S\frac{dv}{dt} = ASv$, and $u(0) = Sv(0)$

Again from calculus, the solution of $\frac{dx}{dt} = ax$ is $x(t) = ae^{at}x(0)$. Now lets write this equation with a matrix $\Lambda$. For a vector 'v', $\frac{dv}{dt} = \Lambda v$, the solution is $v(t) =  e^{\Lambda t}v(0)$. For 'u', we just substitue the values, we get $$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S e^{\Lambda t} S^{-1}u(0) $$

We started from $U'=AU$. Now we know that if $U = e^{At}$ then it solves the equation. Hence, $e^{At}=S\Lambda e^{\Lambda t} S^{-1}$.

We also know that $e^x = 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/(3!)+....$. Now, let's replace 1 with $I$ and x with $At$ $$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$

Here (minute 40), I will slightly deviate from lecture here: 
$$e^{\Lambda t} = I+\Lambda t+(\Lambda t)^2/2+(\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....$$

Substituting this in the equation for u(t), 
$$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S (I+\Lambda t+(\Lambda t)^2/2+(\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....) S^{-1}u(0) $$
$$ u(t) = (I+S \Lambda S^{-1}t+S(\Lambda t)^2S^{-1}/2+S(\Lambda t)^3S^{-1}/(3!)S^{-1}+....) u(0) $$

Since $u(t) = e^{At}u(0)$, and A is $S^{-1}\Lambda S$, we have
$$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$

As before :)

Remember : A is diagonalizeable

(Edited based on the suggestion of Tony Jiang below)

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I dont know if there is any comment on this explanation, but I think there is a mistake in 09:15 > u’ shold be R X^r-1 and not just R > hence this should be the expression when you pass U to multply… R x^r ( x^r-1) / x^r / then you simplify and get R (x^r-1)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I was Told I Have  Hi Functioning Autism 


So I See The World Somewhat in A Different Way 

When I Was In Grade School I ask My First Grade Teacher What would Happen When A Meatball  Is Dropped Of A Tall Building Consisting  Of More Then   70  Floors Or Higher
As We Know We Can't  Take in To Practice The Above Actions Because Of 9/11. 

  Here is The Way I  Would Like To Do This.

 Take Meatballs  Cooed In A Oven And  Look At Them Under A Microscope And Then Drop Them Off The Building From The Roof  On To A Plate On The Ground Then Look At The Again 
Then Without Touching The Meat Balls Bring One Up To The Roof Of The Building. One In the Elevator And The Other In The  The Stirs Of the Building  I believe That The Meatball that is Dropped  Will Shrink Some What Because How The Laws Of Physics Grover en the Meatballs.

DR. Strang thank you for another classic lecture and selection of examples on Positive Definite and  Semidefinite Matrices.

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the coughing noise is freaking annoying!!  but this video is awesome.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The dude in the left corner at 11:02 eating a sandwich clearly knows the entire course already.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Thank You.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the way he says parallelogram <3

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Best way to learn -> Understand and understand how precious education opportunity we all here get just by generous decision by MIT and prof Strang. We never pay any(even ads), we even can do repeat as much as we want and stop for a while to think or write.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Need a lot of practice to write everything in capital wow . Well done lecture

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
is it worth for iitjee exams. coz I care about clearing my concepts?

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lec 8 missing ?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not all of them pay, most of them have scholarship...

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
that's really called mathematics.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
is there snowfall outside 
?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Fantastic, excellent lecture thank you.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 50:23 if x - xo is not zero as we multiped it to the numerator and denominator why then we are taking f`(x).(x-xo) as zero

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
GOOD

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thx MIT! I don't need to go to class anymore!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm a second year calculus student, and I find these videos very helpful. thank you MIT, for making these awesome videos.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
my only complaint is that he should've explained the notation he used for quantition .Because It's not as simple as it looks deltau stands for u(x+delta×)-u(x) and with the u which stands for u(x) those cancel out so there is the main equation for the derivatives without the explanation for not so sceptical students this could really go wrong I'm just saying

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Accent ❤️

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don´t think ppl will respond to this as most of the comments are from years ago, but anyway. I didn´t understand the "conversion factors" when he got 40pi to be 125(1000) kcal. 


I´m studying for economics so it would be nice to learn some more science as well as calculus :)

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What about hyperbolic functions?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
cool

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT Opencourseware, I see a problem. When he explains about th general derivative formulas at the beginning, he writes (cu)'=cu'...but this multiplication of derivatives is I think supposed to be c'u+cu'...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT open courseware.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Never saw this derivation of determinant before.  Needed a break at midpoint

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
hey...
what course does 21.01 stand for??

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
The best teacher teaching this material as far as I know. I wonder whether his books are as good as his lectures. May he still have a long and healthy life. :)

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Squeeze theorem to find limits of triagonometric functions.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
tbh I prefer blackboard or whiteboards in math classes. it makes it easier to take notes.

I'm in first year of information of systems, we are studying it now, it's awsome, I love calculation, I love make programs to solve problems :) I love it, Very nice!!! my dream is study at MIT D:

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the most intuitive and comprehensive calculus lecture I've seen. Thank you, MIT!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He reminds of my Calc 1prof, a French girl.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
the lecture and the teacher of my life!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
its not that he thinks they are obvious but rather they are arithmetic steps that can be easily solved. 

For example ((2+3)+(5-2))^2=64 

Now, I skipped a few steps but Id rather jst tell you the answer because you already know how to get the answer Im giving you. 

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Use to think part 5 is easier than the former parts, but now I think part 5 is the hardest of all lol

### 4. Counting
From 9:10 was professor saying Putin in the subset????

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Rather than maths, the other subject vedios donot have lyrics. I hope they will take necessary steps as early as possible.

### 34. Final Course Review
"it works, don't mess with it, it works" Gilbert Strang.
But seriously though I will be forever grateful for these lectures. Thank you very fn much!!!!!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
34:43 why "directional second derivative" would not give us a clue of whether it is a min or max? I thought it is a promising way. hmmm. 

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
All hail Hamilton

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
All matrices matter, no such thing as a good or a bad matrix :P

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I find it interesting that there were ~278,000 views of the first lecture, but only ~90,000 views of this one... I wonder if MIT has that sort of drop-out rate ;-). 

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
respect from hungary. wish i have you in my university instead of prof. szegedi gabor

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I can't imagine how much has he taught me. You are the best teacher in the world!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Totally useless......this shows that not everything that comes from MIT is useful

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
bit all over the place but that's the nature of trig

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have never been explained calculus in a clearer way. Excellent, absolutely excellent. As a math major with education minor, it is a priceless opportunity to watch these extremely skilled teachers. This is how teachers should be. This is how I'll strive to be. Thank you.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does the US & UK not use the metric system?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The most important is the Students NOT the Stuff in the University or the Multimedia Sources.
The Most important thing to force students understand the concepts .
Thank you

### 18. Properties of Determinants
i love you gilbert

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
In this course, I still did not get why we are considering or learning column space or row space or matrix space, the aim of linear algebra was to solve Ax = b, how the column/row/matrix space come in the picture? 
Please explain.

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
if you don't remember that please take an immediate remedy hahahhahaha valid tho

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Really good videos!! This series are helping me pretty much!! I'm from Brazil and I'm loving this videos!! 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
“Did I just invent a negative one? Thanks! You get an A for the course.”  Awesome 😎

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
@[USERNAME]But where do we get the d vector in the formula for the G = X^T * X matrix?

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Go to mit ocw scholar site and check out the calculus 1 course,it has all the tests and solutions.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So brilliant.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
OMG I studied this at uni, but I haven't used maths in a long time. I was trying to figure out how he got a 5. Took me 10 minutes to work out that 1 - - 4 = 5

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
The best visualization on conditional continuous r.v. I've ever seen (even after I've already taken some courses on probability).

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

🖤

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I can't stand dislikes on stuff like this. That doesn't even make a statement when so few are towered by so many.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:25 funny

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Well isn't math reality?

Like, vector fields are useful in describing electromagnetism and forces etc., which are real.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He Using Simmons Book

### 7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars
I am not an MIT student, but I study OpenCourseWare allowing me to further my education. Thank you for providing this material. Mr. Sipsen did a good job on these videos, I like how they are long and in-depth.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Thing that  he  said  eventually is so  nice  for  the  computer  engineers  to  understand  how  computational circuits  uses  FFT  in  order to increase efficiency 🥰🥰🥰  legend  Gilbert

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
One point I think he should have emphasized more is that concatenation with the empty language gives you the empty language.
Then it becomes obvious why no arrow is the same as the arrow with and the empty language.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
why can't covid lectures be like this?

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is not difficult. I'd have assumed that MIT would have a more advanced treatment of this

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Enlightened !! Thanks Prof. Gilbert..

### 3. Independence
42:40 every childbirth is basically a coin flip. yeah, right.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank you..!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
we've used it without proving it but that's okay we only llive so long, let's skip that proof. :))

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
It took me some time to convince myself why As has two identical rows. The example only shows an example of 2x2 matrix, but the question of why is still there.  Someone helps explain this? 


I have a thought on this. We know that the reduced row echelon form of A has no more than 1 of "1" at each row and cols. If we multiply a row of A (let's say the 1st row) with a col of C^T (let's say 2nd col), we get 0 because each co-factor matrix in 2nd col of C^T (e.g. C21) always consist a zero vector. (C21 consists of zero vector of col  1 of A). Thus, their product is 0. 

Is it the right thought?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I agree.
> Just one small correction at 32:30: It should have been S * LAMBDA^100 * c instead of LAMBDA^100 * S * c.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Thank you so much MIT for providing high quality courses like that OMG !

And i'm entering my math major next month, that's a GREAT TIMING😄

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
It is awesome! Thank you professor!

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
YAY FOR MORE CALC VIDEOS! 
I waited for so long lol :D

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The fact that he has to explain the last proof a few times to different people tells us something.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you professor for all your efforts through the way of teaching us maths in an understandable and clear way!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like his accent....

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Lot of rhetorical questions indeed .

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
This man is a master expositor

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
dam so much chalk in every stroke..interesting.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Small point - in the last proof, the theorem is for c >= -1, but we only proved for c >= 1. It's trivial to prove, but still worth noting, I think.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
"The Professor": who makes sure that students do not miss even the tiniest detail of any concept.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
41:40 "gauss-given order" LOL

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That was an outstanding explanation.....👌👌

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the proof for MVT is not rigorous, there is no proof that there exists a c where tangent exists on the curve. Also when the Professor says f' > 0, we does not specify where, does he mean f' > 0 for all points between [a,b] because the function can be increasing from a to b (ie f(b) > f(a)) and MVT says is there is some point c between [a,b] for which f'(c) > 0 and there can be other points c' where f(c') < 0. so the reverse is not true, ie if f'(c) > 0, for some c between [a,b] that does not specific f is increasing.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This guy is really a asset. Gonna recommend this interview to couple of my professors.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This professor got to be the most clueless person when it comes to teaching, I am sorry, it is TERRIBLE! He seems to have an ability to complicate matters that are actually simple to understand. I did this course basically watching youtube videos, I could NOT rely on the classes slides or the lectures. TERRIBLE! He knows his stuff, of course, but you know how some people are just terrible at teaching? That is it.. And he has no idea either that in fact he lost most of the class half way through.. Young still so maybe he can become better but this class was something else I tell you.. It also didnt help that this course should have been divided into 2 or even 3 parts. Anyway, my two cents here.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This helped alot. Thanks!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
This lecture is basically broken by the fact that there is a continuation mismatch to 1. - references to concepts and theories are made that were never discussed in the previous lecture.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Prof. G. S. is awesome

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
so is this for vector calculus or multivariable calculus??? or are they just same?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn't MIT students already know calc 1?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2J4KzpsTHw&list=UUJ00ltJb9z260cQFNM7U2eQ&index=1

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I'm literally in awe of what I can understand thanks to Dr. Strang

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the virginity is strong there pal...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The stance in 2:28 though.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Strang is just the best teacher in the entire world, hands down. Imagine if all teachers had this level and passion for teachin... We would be living in a utopia.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
How wonderful!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks prof. Strang and MIT, videos are great

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Why don't he show specific examples?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Brilliant

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
beautifully simple how that Fibonacci worked out

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's the first time I've understood everything. Every piece of info is very clearly explained. Thanks

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I wish I could have found these gem of videos much earlier in my life

smart is the new sexy, how you explain the knowledge is so damn sexy

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
tremendous explanation thank you for sharing ... 

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think he made mistake noting that the formula for T prime (Time diliation) is for general Relativity.


### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thansk man

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I just don’t understand why talking about statistics for hours!! It is not that hard to give an introduction!!

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Epic

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
love Prof. Strang!!!

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So... I was feeling kind of hip so I started simplifying the 1/8 - cos(4x) /8 into terms with only x and I ended up with just sin^2(x) cos^2(x).. 
Now that's pretty interesting right cause it's the same as the integrand plus a constant. 
Anyone tried this?

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
I like to hear Prof. Tsitsiklis say "equally likely".

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks. I am mexican and I want to say this videos are amazing

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Is this class more for people taking Computer Science or is it more geared towards Engineering or both?

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
I hope he lives to AT LEAST 197.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This guy gives the lecture as if there were a full class of students sitting there. Amazing

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor Jerison, thank you so much for giving such a fascinating calculus series!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
We cannot see the the top portion of the blackboard.  Who filmed this?  I hope it gets fixed in the next videos.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Really great lecture! Will start looking at the following videos soon!
One sidenote: In the last twenty seconds there are not CC subtitles.
It's does not effect me, but might confuse people who can't hear.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
So much respect and admiration for Professor Strang

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Do I need to know calculus for this ;(. I will learn that after and watch this again.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For those who have struggled with the where does -k and -b came from: See that   y^|| = dy^| / dt = -by^| - ky

### 15. Poisson Process II
wonderful teaching. the examples he taught at the end makes me laugh. The bus crowdedness example is great!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
you mean a mess ^^

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
09:30 Example 1: Non-Singular Matrix

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
where can I find all lectures of MIT 6.041?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Distance between Clinton and Monica...🤣lmao that was a good one

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I did't understand at the first view nor at the 2nd one but at the 3rd or even at the 4th time waw CRAZY approach !

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
There are not n! distinct ways to reorder the matrix.  Only n!/2 I believe.  Because swapping rows 1 and 3 is the same thing as swapping rows 3 and 1.  Consider a 3 x 3 matrix does not have 6 different row swaps.  i can swap 1,2 1,3, or 2,3 that's all.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can somebody explain the thing he said at 15:58 ,delta L is equal to delta h by delta L, where did he get that formula

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
While deriving the directional derivative, how did we approximate dr/ds=1 ( He said we're moving with unit speed. Firstly, why? And even if we are, how does that make dr/ds=1? )

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Concept of Eigenvector at 1:02

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Professor, really respect you ! Thank you and God bless :)


### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have tried to study differentials through multiple sources and am always confused. In this video, he explicitly addresses the problem of trust in differentials. This is my first time to grasp the concept.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
At 13:20 how he decided the dimension of null space as  2 from x?

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Now I regret not watching all of his videos although I knew they were available and great videos!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Brainstorming , Mind-boggling  

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
really Mr stang is  osm professor

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

I have a doubt at 12:47 if I have a matrix in M which is [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 1,0,0] which is neither a part of Symmetric matrix or upper triangular matrix, then how come on doing S+U I get all 3x3 matrices?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
we are so lucky 🫶🏼

Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Dude you're amazing

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like the fact that he wrote very big on the board. I have myopia and I can't see anything the lecturer writes in my college.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Just to the point! Clear and Concise! He is my hero!

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Everyone is excited for this course but only very few will complete it from start to finish.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
When he says *OK* you know it's about to get good 😂😂

### 34. Final Course Review
I completed the 18.06 today.
I started on 2020.03.16 in Japan(I'm Chinese) and today is 03.29. These 14 days absolutely changed my life and inspired me.
And Math is a whole new thing to me now. 
This lecture was not like a lecture, it's much more like a game, a journey, an inspiring movie.
Thank you, Professor Strang, and thank you, people who made Mandarin subtitles for this video lecture!
Professor Strang, you are the BEST TEACHER in my whole life. And I will remember the lecture 18.06 forever.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Will the column space of A be a plane if there are only 2 rows, like if A is something like { 2, 1, 1; 1, 6, 3 }? Although the three columns are independent, without a third component, it will only cover a plane, right?

thinking about vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors are, well, difficult indeed

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
At 19:03, 5 minutes of 18.06 is enough to take care of 18.03. That's mathematics prof trash talk for ya.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
just great! This course is the best to clear up all the mess that is all around the testing hypothesis in various sources!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Watching this course like i watch a series on netflix :D . This is the best explanation of LINEAR ALGEBRA and today i  finally understood what is actually meant by MATRIX multiplication. Thanks a lot Gilbert Strang.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
what b turns out to b :D

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
It may be worth to note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are, and also looking at the networks in a more structured manner thus making clear how the basic ideas of BPP apply to much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Who else is still a teenager

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The integral of sinx is pretty easy.
If you want to calculate the area from 0 to n times pi, just check if n is odd or even. If its odd then the area is 2, if its even area is equal to zero.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
I Really Like The Video From Your Lecture 32: Quiz 3 Review.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Even though I've learned Linalg from my undergraduate course, it was ages ago. Thanks to Prof Strang, the explanation of the geometry meaning of the matrix is much clearer than what I've ever been given.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
it's LeibniTz not Leibniz

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i have learned a lot from these lectures--but i just which prof Auroux would just step throgh the algebra--he always skips steps--then says "everyone see that"--no one does--and then back tracks--tedious.  Well--i am sure having to do the steps at all is tedious for him.  Overall--he manages to pack a lot of insight into 45 minutes each and every time

### 14. Poisson Process I
I am having a hard time making sense of the notation at 11:22.  I believe the notation should be the conditional probability P(k|t) rather than P(k,t). I interpreted the latter to be the joint probability and if it is the case, the summation over all k of P(k,t) given a fixed t could not be equal to 1. Anyone, please help knock some sense to my head!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The proofs he used were totally solid. They're also nice because they're very intuitive. L'Hospital's would be premature on the third day (assuming you want to be very rigorous). 

It might help if he explained that, as theta goes to zero (in the limit), the lines of the angle get closer and closer to parallel. Then he could draw the picture with two parallel lines, in which case the 1 - Cos(theta) segment would be gone (zero).

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Don't think you're going to just get away with throwing mad shade at Python. We see you.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
이게 대학교 과정이라니

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
What a boss professor. Wish we had these at my school.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
20:45

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
when the hell would you use this in a real life situation outside of education?

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wa... Wa... Wa... Are these students really MIT's students?  Wa.... I am flabbergasted by their questions.  How many of them have full SAT scores? :0

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
If you are reading this Post Rapture:
Rev 14:6 - And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
Rev 14:7 - Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

Pre Rapture:
Mark 16:15 - And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
 - You've broken 1 of the 10 commandments and are guilty of sin if you've ever lied, or stolen, or lusted.  Works of righteousness will not save you.  Jesus Christ is the only way.
Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans 10:9 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

I ask you to rethink what you know about God.  Rethink what you've been taught.  God wants a relationship, not a religion.  
 - Jesus came to die for all mankind ... not kill them.
 - Jesus came to bring salvation for all mankind ... not condemnation.
 - Jesus came to be an example, a light to the world .. not to force people into submission.

1.  Humble yourself before the Lord
2.  Admit to the breaking of His laws as found in the 10 commandments
3.  Ask for His forgiveness for those sins
4.  By faith, believe Jesus died on the cross for your sins
5.  Confess with your mouth that Jesus is your Lord and Savior
6.  By faith, believe Jesus rose from the dead  
7.  Receive the gift of salvation and the Holy Spirit will fill you

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Exactly. A good friend of mine got a free ride at MIT.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
No we don't have to use gradient decent in this case

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am completely following the mit courseware to study my pre engineering courses awesome > thanks MIT

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Proffesor Auroux talking about Topology kind of made me smile

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
29:30

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
The last ten minute discussion in a nutshell :
If A has independent columns then Ax=0 only for x=0 
Then multiply A^T on both sides of Ax=0 
A^T Ax=0 only true for x=0
So no combination of columns of 
A^T A gives 0
As A^T A is symmetric 
No combination of rows of A^T A gives 0 hence A^T A is invertible bcz if combination of rows give 0 then determinant is 0

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think there is a mistake at 10:44 where it was 1-r“2 and integrate it becomes r“3 not r“4

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
42:50

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Maybe it is posible put subtitles spanish,  gracias.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I'm a bit unsure as to why he doesn't like the 10 in the matrix E around 19:00? Are we assuming we already have A and U defined, and just need to find a matrix that relates them? Is it because the L parts, like the E parts (E21, E31, E32) can simply be stated, but to calculate the final L and E, final L can be stated (just like it's parts), where as E has to be calculated?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Educating the third world in how to develop. Thanks open course MIT for profit and google. Kills us via global warming why don’t you

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great professor, great lecture although it seems there are no students, great chalk and also great gesture at 20:14! xD

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
If gradient is always orthogonal to any tangent plane on the surface then how come the chain rule (grad f dot dr) doesn’t always equal zero? In other words for f(x,y) why doesn’t fxdx + fydy always equal zero.

### 34. Final Course Review
thank you ! Prof. and MIT

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What book is used for this course?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
"Don't take the videotape quite so carefully"... Camera zooms in right after lmao

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Because delta v represents the change of the value of v from the original v(x) value (in other words, delta v = "new" v - "old" v). As delta x goes to zero, "new" v and "old" v become the same (if v is continuous at this "old" v value, by the definition of continuity), and therefore the delta v approaches zero. Make sense?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in the first minute and 30 seconds there were more girls on screen than all of my math classes up to calc 3 

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
RIP. He will be missed.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
16 x Row 1 - 9 x Row 2 = Row 3

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
Do the additive and multiplicative inverses have to be unique? The notation -x and x^(-1) suggests so, but the statement of the axiom ("there exists") seems to suggest there may be more than one.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
46:29 one to the last row in the matrix left side should be x_1^(r1-1), x_2^(r1-1), etc. instead of r-1

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is it just me, or does this lecture stop working at 2:31? I've restarted, but nothing.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

intro to linear transformations and horrors of linear algebra haha

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
In linear case, regulation for l2 norm is just pseudo inversion! How about nonlinear case say the case in the deep learning?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1 shot for every time he says "the chain rule"

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
For the life of me I couldn't "get" the final proof, but now I think I get it. If (A^T A) has linearly independent columns, then A has linearly independent columns. The first is (A^T A)x = 0, and the latter is Ax=0. Remember that linear independence means that the only combination that goes to zero is the zero vector. If C(A) is linearly independent, then Ax=0 means x=0.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
I give up everything, watching film and sufing web just to comprehend this amazing content given by this gifted professor omg.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
da miedo , parece como las series un profesor psciopata

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The way Prof. Strang explains how det(A-λI) = 0 comes is so enlightening! Wish I had taken to this course earlier.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
He forgot to finish PCA.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
Correct me if I'm wrong, it seems to me that in order to account for the empty transitions in an NFA, the proof that NFA languages are regular would need to utilize the result that a union of regular languages is regular. If so, using the regularity of NFA languages to prove that a union of regular languages is regular is perhaps circular, and perhaps the most important aspect of the proof of regularity for NFA was brushed over.

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone say why we didn't use absolute value for y after taking the integral?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Great teacher. thanks you MIT for the high quality courses you share.

26:30 start doing algebra furiously :D

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Apparently it's hard to see a teachers who understand the subject and explains it to student, but Dr. Strang just know exactly what he's doing, love it!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Notes: 
32:00 If a matrix A is added by a multiple of Identity, and its eigenvalues will turned out to be the multiple number + A’s eigenvalues.

(A+B)x != (a+b)x because we cannot sure if x is the eigenvectors for both A and B, works the same for (AB)x

39:00 With an example of orthogonal rotation matrix:
1. Trace has to be the sum of the eigenvalues and the det has to be the product of the eigenvalues.
2. There is a trouble in orthogonal rotation matrix since we don’t have any eigenvector parallel to the Ax. The eigenvalues will appear to be the imaginary number.

46:20 With an example of a a11 = 3, a12= 1, a21 = 0, a22 =3 (Triangular matrix)
1. Eigenvalues will appear to be in the diagonal. 
2. The number of eigenvectors could be less than the the number of eigenvalues

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
My linear algebra class at Columbia used his textbook and my professor even recommended that we watch his videos. Gilbert Strang taught me that mathematics is elegant and beautiful and I ultimately switched from physics to math after this course.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Please, does somebody know what is name's book adopted by this course ? Or, better, a list of books recommended to read during this course by the lecturer ?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Prof. Strang, you may not a true physicist but you are a true magician.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Lectures like this one make me regret not taking Linear Algebra in college. However, I would probably never have come across Prof Strang's lectures had I did. Such a great teacher for showing how interesting and useful a subject that I once thought was so dull.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]Ofcourse someone who likes math doesn't need to like every lesson, but the only reason to view this is to learn something, and if you don't learn something from this it's probably because you have already studied this, you aren't on this level yet, or you are just stupid. Theese things are your own fault (possibly parents) and there is no reason to blame the video.

so, one question for anyone expert on this or understands it,
how does X = [-F I], becomes [-1 -1 1] in the end?
or in the first example, how it does become the c[-2 1 0 0]   +  d[2 0 -2 1]

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
47:20 There are various reasons why 0!=1. First to come in mind is that if you work backwards from n! you'll find that (n-1)! = n!/n, so 0!= 1!/1 =1. Then there is the definition of "empty product". Empty sum is of course 0 because when you add your first term a to 0 you get a. So in same sense empty product should be 1 as you multiply with your first term a with 1 you get a. And 0! is an empty product, so it value should be 1. Those are reasons totally outside of the rationale that it must be so that the series work but it is consitent with that.

Hmm, did Professor Strang copy the first question down wrong? At the end he gets x=2, y=1, and z=-2 but the last row in the question says 4y-4z = 2. Am I missing something ?

### 3. Independence
why is the probability of P(1head) is 3p(1-p)^2...? Shouldnt it be 2p(1-p)^2, because only 2 probability it would happen instead of 3.... or am i not understanding it clearly? its in 9:14 please help

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For that first example, I don’t think assuming the solution was the Iinear combination of exponentials was the right way to go. Of course, it’s correct, but it’s not very instructive. I solved this example problem in my own, and this is what I did:
Broke the system of odes into a system of difference equations (finite element approximations of the odes). Then I solved for the vector one node away in terms of the first node by reapplying something like u_(n+1)=A*u_n over and over. The computational hack here is that A being middle diagonalizable matrix doesn’t actually need to be multiplied many, many times. Once you get your answer, take the limit of your solution such that the difference equations converge to the original odes, and boom, you have your solution. It blew my mind a lil bit when I got the right answer lol 😅.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nobody told him when he made a mistake at 2:26?

What makes MIT students better than me again?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I've been watching all the precedent videos understanding most of what happens, but I always found that I had no link between what I saw and what I know already. I could not integrate the new set of concepts to my current knowledge. It was quite puzzling. Now with the first 18 mins of this lecture everything just clicked. It's like I was floating in space having a hard time navigating but still could move from one point to another. Now I got gravity. This is quite impressive.

There are no topological considerations in here !? Only Maxwell's equations.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This man cooked up some vectors AND insulted MIT's floor integrity. Legend

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Nice lecture. I feel that for that last bit it's more useful to say that augmenting a matrix by the identity matrix for the matrix captures the operations done to the augmented matrix in the augmented region of the matrix. In this case we did the operations to produce the identity matrix out of A. That is A inverse. 
If I'm getting this right. First time doing this stuff.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
my faculty (FRI UNIZA SLOVAKIA) says we are following MIT curriculum, i spent 2 semesters with algebra and noone explained what is algebra, we just spent 24 weeks by calculating and useles theory. This lecture is made in for me foreign language, and i understand it better than in my mother tongue.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

I thought only physicists do that.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
A very clear spoken professor.
I learned a new word. "Bashful" just from the context he used the word in.
I assumed Bashful meant shy because he asked the students that were bashful to sit far back.
Which indicates the word "shy" as in the term "camera-shy".

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
In minute 1:12:26 he says "it's taboo to write on the back board." Why they don't use the back board and why is it taboo?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof. Auroux is the goat

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Wish this guy taught me Math 293 and 294 at Cornell. My guy could barely speak English, let alone explain what we were trying to accomplish. I understood that if we wanted eigenvectors perpendicular to x we'd get lift relative to flow...but this guy would have made the math a bit simpler.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Cool video

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
you can just substitute new u and v in the formula for (uv)prime
just put 1/v instead of v and you get (u/v)prime

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
40:37 "I got excited thinking about math". Best

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
*Question:* what is the relationship between rank(A) and rank(A^T)? Does rank(A) = rank(A^T) in general?

The professor seems to be hinting at this, but rref(A) only preserves the column space, so it doesn’t seem so trivial to me. Any insight is highly appreciated.

Edit: I found the answer. rank(A) = rank(A^T) by virtue of the fact that linear independence of the columns implies linear independence of the rows, even for non-square matrices. I proved this for myself this evening. The main idea for the proof (at least how I did it) is that if you have two linearly dependent rows, one above the other say, row reduction kills the lower one (reduces number of possibly independent rows). Killing off the row (making the row all zeros) also makes it so that the given row can’t have a pivot. Thus, we’ve reduced the number of potential pivot columns by one. That’s the relationship in a nutshell. The math is only slightly more involved

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I agree about the chalk, really.  I find myself so tired of looking at a computer screen, and having to deal with the 32 or however many flashes of light per second day in, day out.  Somehow the teacher feels more present and more connected to the material when using chalk, I think.  
I dislike online assignments too.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
how did most of them get the vector and plane problem wrong..these are MIT students right?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I am curious if there's another statistics class on OCW that is recommended as well as this course on probability?  

This is the class I think will benefit me most but I think a statistics class with video lectures would be excellent.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
The essence lies in the last 6 to 7 minutes. Now I understood schematically hows and whys of Bayes's rule

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
this guy is a master chalk operator

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
No. It should be 5 since we are subtracting row 2 FROM row 3. So i.e 1-(-4) = 5

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
6:50 That is the straightest line drawn by hand in the history of humanity.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
16:45 should be a 10.

These lectures are amazing! I've learned so much from these videos. :) And the professor rocks.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I am confused with his proof that 1 = 0 and the reason why it's incorrect. He says that this is because the set of real points is uncountable (i.e. not a sequence).

But what if we take a discrete grid of points (infinitely many), or for simplicity a 1D line of discrete points, i.e. the set of all integers Z. Then again we have that P(i) = 0, because there are infinitely many of them and they are all equally probable. But now, the set is countable, i.e. it is a sequence, and hence 1 = P(Ω) = sum(P(i)) = 0. What is wrong with this reasoning?

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a math degree and I still enjoy these lectures. Auroux is a great lecturer.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've been preparing for college in Italy for a couple months now with the official books and I can't help noticing one fundamental difference between the american and the european teaching philosophy: americans appeal to your common sense to make learning easy and fun, while europeans try to make it as formal and meticulous as possible so that you get used to working your ass off.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
hypothesis testing actually starts at 52:13

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
How do we actually see what sigma1 is the maximum blow-up factor and what v1 is the vector what gets blown up the most? Because i initially thought it would be the first eigenvector, and then it would make sense, but then i realised what sigma is not an eigenvalue after professor said it and i'm struggling a bit with imagening what's happening here

By educating the world, you directly develop international worker competition as well as international business competition.  The result is that you hurt the American worker and you hurt American business.  Why would you accept US taxes and US donations to promote what is against the national interest?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Millions of likes <3

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
If you're not getting why those entries turned out to be zero. Here is a proof for it:

### 3. Independence
The subtitles are in the way. I would guess they would still be in the way if you were deaf.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
the real doctor strange

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Professor and MIT

### 3. Independence
The context of the problem on 43:24 is so rude! Why does
 only a king can be born in this family??? Do you have something against female's rights to become a queen?? By the way, the formulation of this problem is so ridiculous. We can not say that there was born a boy or a girl, because a child have not identified its gender yet!!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
20:05 "y is changing ten times as fast as" x, not b.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To everyone being rude to the student, he's actually not completely off like you wrongly assume. Because if you have parentheses around the number in the superscript/exponent it can be used to denote a higher order derivative, like f⁽⁵⁾(x) can be used instead of the much less readable f'''''(x).

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the best mathematics instruction I have EVER experienced. Thanks!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Can be explained by lambda calculus, much more concise and graceful

### 34. Final Course Review
Awesome Lectures!

I think the solution to the last question in the final exam is wrong on the ocw site. D5=63 and not 207. 
D1=3,D2=7,D3=3*7-2*3=15,D4=3*15-2*7=31,D5=3*31-2*15=63!
You can take a look at the jupyter notebook for the exam here.  You can download and use it for your purpose...

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
There are X logical statements that explains Y algebra is useful to learn in science and tech; and Y it can be used to do N things in life, for any kinds of operation that 1 can care to image, including the use of imaginary numbers for complex tasks themselves.  It is all about integration and the sequences that have to be followed to achieve equality and reason in all of knowledge, so that we can have the opportunity to be the greatest at numeration and denomition as well as domination of those lessor; for X > Y when X have more knowledge then Y.  Y?  Because of Z!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 18. Properties of Determinants
@[USERNAME]
he explains that if you multiply only one row. so he did it correct.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the infinite discontinuity is a type of a jump discontinuity.

### 3. Independence
i noticed that only when i watch MIT lectures i get not only the definitions but how to imagine the space on which the whole picture is all about!
that's crucial!!!

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
"randomness is a big rug under which we sweep everything we don't understand"
I fucks with this

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Art!

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
Around 41:33, I think the number of pivots  should be (n pos + m neg) pivots since A is a m by n matrix and (-A*inv(S)*A^T) is a m by m matrix.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah , it gets complicate when derivated formulus are thrwon in the mix.

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Thanks for posting! @MIT

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
where was this back last semester >.< this was my subject.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Could someone explain if there is a reason for using any other method other then the clasic way to multiply? I mean even the row and column multiplications are using the clasic method, you just take the columns or the rows bit by bit.

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"unapropriate" LOL

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
v and w belong to s...v+w belongs to s..but need not belong to intersection of s intersec T...so hows that a proof

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I follow your videos, Sir. the best of the best.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
AX = b
  pivots
  associative law A(BC) = (AB)C
   row ops start at left
   col ops start at right

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
apart from the 40'57" problem i had the rest was brilliant
that's if you're still with us

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think that's why most undergraduate engineering programs don't require people to go beyond Differential Equations and Linear Algebra; because beyond that it starts getting more and more abstract. 

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
He is certainly right that even the best would fare well to add anything. To have the pleasure of his lectures is more than gold.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Ahhh!!! Mind blown near the end!!!

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
damn girl didn't want to take a seat. disrupting my learning environment. 

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Could you make a playlist of just proofs?

### 34. Final Course Review
Just impressive! 

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
"these things are not vectors, but we can cal them vectors"

this guy is not einstein, but we can call him einstein!

### 34. Final Course Review
Finished this course on 06/08/2021 :)

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you very much Professor Strang. I am a medical student, so the last time I did anything involving linear algebra was years ago. But I got pulled in research involving bioinformatics, so this course was very valuable to quickly get a sense of how to think about matrices. Thank you again for your very intuitive, clear and, at times, humorous teaching.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Can't wait for the next one!

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Thanks Prof. Strang!! very clear and easy to understand!

### 34. Final Course Review
thanks Professor Strang, You inspire people to love math, as they should!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At t = 11:00, finding the complete solution to Ax = b.

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ds 2 = dx2  + dy 2

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
A is mxn matrix b is usually mx1 matrix then how can we multiply Ab in Krylov method

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
well i think every where does that, but man they don't spend an entire module on the basics we do that at high school we get into something in particular very fast. You really don't realise how good teaching MIT students get, they get everything handed to them its crazy un fair!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Quality Of this Video Content is poor

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Respected sir

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i wonder how many majors will go into using this shit

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this course for beginners.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you, Dr. Strang.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
I'm fairly certain x includes 255 in the domain. [4:15]
Can anyone confirm or clarify? 
(should be x is less than or equal to 255, rather than strictly less than)

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Οne question about the Reduced Matrix R.

When he says at the end (41:06) again that the pivots of the R should all of them be equal to 1, 
it this the generic rule that:

a) all pivots of any R will be equal to 1
b) OR all pivots of any R will have the same value (e.g all 5 or all 10)?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
super lecture, super teacher

### 3. Parametric Inference
For those of you who are absolute beginners, yes this course might be quite hard to follow. However for people like me, who have not took statistics or probability theory courses during their undergraduate studies but have some background whatsoever, this course is very insightful and beautifully brought together.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent prof of Mathematics, Sir Your lectures are very attractive.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not sure what text he uses, but if you're looking for a good calc book I would try the one written by Swokowski (Calculus: Fifth Edition). He has passed away so that is the latest one by him, and you can find a used copy for dirt cheap. They do offer a new version of his fifth edition on amazon, but they charge 60 bucks (as opposed to the 3 bucks I paid at a used book store). It's very well written

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you professor David Jerison for this awesome lectures

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Raise your hand if you are watching it in 2023!

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
very helpful

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is a lame teacher.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
35:19

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Lecturing to an empty room. I like the honesty. lol

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYS0-gf-J_M&t=34s

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I saw that this doesn't require a textbook, but if we wanted a resource to supplement studying with this OCW what textbook would you recommend?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
15:30 lol

### 18. Markov Chains III
The lecture is marvelous. Thanks, professor John Tsitsiklis.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I request to instructors or everyone who watches this message. Can you guys suggest to me any good book from which I can study multivariable calculus deeply with intrigue and sincerity?

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
It is much easier using a discrete random variable X to explain the posterior probability.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
3:50 "Useful to have in our hands" ...But where is his right hand ????    o.O

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Dr. Strang thank you  for being such an amazing lecturer

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
even the chalk quality is great

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is it relevant for JEE

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Is this Mr. Sipser himself?  It's been some years that I read his book. Had a love-hate relationship with that subject lol.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
In the 2009 lectures he is quite young as compared to now. How did he grow so old in 10 years?

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Poor Recording.. can't hear anything

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I never thought I would be able to comment "first" on any Strang lecture O__O Lucky me XD

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
His teaching style seems casual and intuitive. I go to a small public college and the course is much more formal and proof driven. These lectures are a great addition to (as well as a nice break from)  formal proofs. Thanks MIT!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Not even a single dislike , that's Gilbert strang for you

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
In 26:47, Is there any relation between L U and L1 U1 L2 U2?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
48:40 doesn't the rank theorem say that : dim(R^3) = rank(A) + dim(Kernel) ? I guess the kernell here is the nullspace, dim(R^3) = 3 and rank(A) = 2  so dimension of NullSpace should be 1 ?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This video is just incredible. I've been watching the Khan Academy LA videos and have covered this over there, but seeing this gives me yet another point of view. Coming at it from a slightly different angle is so good at solidifying the concepts. In this lecture I find Professor Strang keeps things high level and really shows the power of thinking at the high "linear algebra" level. Nice to see a video on projection without a cosine in sight :)

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
those 9 people who disliked this video...

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you, mitocw. <3

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Looks like netflix got the sound from 37:59

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this guy is beautiful...

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I'm curious as to what book Professor Strang is referring to. These lectures, by the way, are absolute masterworks.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
32:24 HE WORKS

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
EEiigenväktoars. Ich liebe es

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Interesting work


### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
going to have to take this whole series cos Real analysis was probably the hardest course I took at UNN

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Freaking awesome professor. authoritative, concise, clear-makes me want to teach math

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
it looks like 1,2,3,4,5 but somehow it doesn't...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 33 surely cos is positive for  360-angle as well?

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Yes, it's just me. I had the screen maximized. Wouldn't pass without minimizing.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
god bless this lecturers and the other teachers , i love the way they teach us ,one day ill be financially supporting this guys hay, a large amount

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
In R^10 we may take a comnination of five vectors in R^10 and what will we have? ..(emming)... God knows.     God: sure..sure, i do know.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
his zeros look like 3eros

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
So Newton's Method is based on using only the first derivative term in the Taylor Series?

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
this was the best lecture in my life .. so far ))

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why not until 39:16 did I realize that he was talking alone this whole time? T_T

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I’m in the top engineering school in all the United States and have already learned this yet MIT still makes it intimidating

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you have to see the diferential equations course; those stupid questions desappear there :D 

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
hello, could anyone explains me the difference between energy function ans snorm taught by professor in lecture 8

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Can't you also use the determinant to figure out that Aᵏ → 0 as K → ∞ ? i.e. if det A < 1 then Aᵏ → 0

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Awesome videos.  Just to let everyne know, you can donate to the open course ware through their website.  Also, you can buy books through amazon where MIT gets money.  I dontated because I really believe in what they are trying to achieve.  

### 17. Markov Chains II
wonderful

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Great Mathematician

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Did he re-film the lectures. I wonder because I see no students in the room.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think this guy just likes writing in chalk lol

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

@[USERNAME]
No money.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dear can u plz tell me abt other online organizations that ARE already free.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
After reviewing probability courses and this one itself many times, I found this lecture to be a great one. Some vague knowledge in real analysis will help. But I still need to come back later after digging deep into other sound footings for foundation. Thank MIT and professor.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thanks legend!!! This course is a key of machine learning area.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That's what tutorials are for. (Sessions with graduate students). Hi from NZ

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
around 32 min , it should be 99square not 100sq

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]LOL same... you from england? Thats where I'm from...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
come back when you teach at MIT

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
How did we get a_31 and b_14?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This attitude of MIT is incredible. Offer the best engineering course in the world to all people. Now, anyone can learn with the highest quality. Thanks, MIT.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This guy is a God. He has blessed himself 😆

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
16 people used the wrong hand to calculate cross product :)

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Such nice illustrations of applications of the theoretical concepts presented thus far. One more teaching masterclass from prof. Strang!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the explanation as well as for the jokes :)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"AHHH, sorry he's still there"

^.^

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
When we write X as [ -F I] T, the number of cols in F is n-r and number of cols in I is r so wont there be a condition for n-r=r??? Confused, pls help

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
The subtitles are out of sync...

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Let me write this "right hand rule down" while you experiment with it...try not to enjoy yourself" hahaha

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
All of our lectures use projectors and computers, nice to see some good old fashioned chalkboards in education =)

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
This SVD business is truly poetry in motion.

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
What is the intuition behind Krylov.why does it work?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
It is better watch some video of Math.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
many many thanks to Gilbert strange

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good lecture. When watching it I came up with an idea, how one could have found the method of approximating e much easier. The method in the lecture was explained in the last 7 minutes, and made me think how to do it without calculus and in 10 seconds. Could not have come up with it if I had not watched the lecture :)

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
He is able to be so wonderfully passionate because he cares that his students understand. So he is able to be in a one-on-one framework while standing and talking to an entire class.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I love the cliff hangers

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Cool vid

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
So excited!!! Let's gooooo

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is Q not on the other side, if we move down (South) from where dh/dx is 0 than also h which decrease  right? I mean dh/dy < 0  for both points right? why only for the upper one?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
9:45
Professor Strang subtly integrates class consciousness into his lecture of the Four Fundamental Subspaces. 
Truly a genius.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I am a physics undergraduate student. Will this course will be helpful for quantum physics and statistical physics?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Amazing. Cannot be explained better.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
When i connected dots in my head around 15 minutes when professor was talking about why we do this projection thing, it was one of the most mind fucking blown moments in my mind. I felt like going from top to bottom in the tiny brain - galaxy brain meme in a span of a second. Amazing course

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I can't figure that out either!  I asked the same question for another video.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the information since it saves time and frustration especially if you need to find Newton's method right away.


### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
at 3:15 - 3:20 Instead of looking at the row picture to realize the dependence we may also see that 2*(column 2) - (column 1) gives (column-3) :)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Sir pls give solution basedvon this chapter

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the worst explanation, amazing!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yeah, is nice to sleep

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
“Help me out right now,” awesome 👏

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For those curious, the law of cosines is also called “Al-Kashi’s law” (in France and the Arab and Persian world). Al Kashi was a Persian mathematician (I encourage you to check his wikipedia page). Great lecture! I was genuinely surprised that what students in Syria are taught in 11th grade, Americans learn in university.. To those from other countries, when did you learn dot product? Just curious

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Im not sure what is more impressive. What his talking about or that there is a professor strang. Yours sincerely matt strang

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Both, but He was Only Evaluating for the Component for Special.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
man, this is good...........

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I got his linear algebra book in 2011, never really finished it as I had graduated and got into different things. Out of curiosity I started this video, it seems like Strang's hands are shaking and twitchy. I didn't realize he had gotten this frail and old, but its interesting to see that the mind is still as sharp as a razor edge. He has done a lot with his life and I hope that people who watch this lecture series go on to carry his legacy when he isn't around any more :')

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i don't understand people QQ'ing about the blackboard. Math on powerpoint ? really ? lol 
Never seen that. Math is a science where you need to be able, at any time, to demonstrate any calculus you make. I don't see that happening on a power point.
Beside, doing the demonstration forces you to explain it, which is better for understanding.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Damn he's good at teaching!

### 34. Final Course Review
Its the 51st day since I began self study on 18.06 and today I finally completed all lectures, assignments and quizzes
I will begin my 18.02 study next week

Thank you professor Strang, Thank you MIT OCW

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
You did calculus at 7 yo and you still don't understand it HAHA

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lol, if I ever do this class... I'll have to remember to decide my favourite curve/surface/vector field/scalar field early on, since I'll be using them so often.  

This guy is very good; very clear and efficient explanations.  

Fibonacci

### 13. Regression
what a mess

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the derivative of U(x)V(x) ,we should add and substract u(x+deltax).v(x) instead of u(x) ..... 

### 17. Markov Chains II

33:11 it's A=3*2^(2/3)*V^(2/3)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For some odd reason teachers with odd or funny accents make me pay attention more lol. No offense intended of course

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
there's something about his lectures that make it so easy for me to concentrate and follow along. I think it's because he thinks out loud; verbalizing the literal thought processes he runs through to compute this stuff, like he himself is learning for the first time and trying to understand what's going on. even though he's on a higher level than all of us mathematically, he still retains such a clear understanding of the basics.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
sir, f sub xy is not always equal to f sub yx

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
at 36.40 how n3/ 3 it hsould be n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
MIT has done great service to mankind, by recording his lectures and sharing them online. This are so beautiful, future generations will remember him as the Mozart of this subject

i understand how they felt when he said Taylor expansion.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing! Hope my professor was like you.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
50:37 Why did not he also calculate the cofactor for a23 in the smaller matrix when he was looking for the cofactor for a21? I know it is still going to be zero because of the zero column on the left but I think he should have made that clear.

### 18. Markov Chains III
may I ask how was 106 phone lines computed? I tried setting pi_b = 0.01 and substituted some numbers to calculate the i needed using the equation at 30:15, but seems the RHS of the equation is getting larger with larger i...

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Professor Strang and to everyone involved in these videos, this course reignited my love for mathematics.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you Gilbert Strang, thank you MIT.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
40:44  (0, -1, 0)

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Changing the order of integration in double integral is indeed equivalent to using the integration By Parts. Let's see how for this example:
Put $f(x)=\int_x^{\sqrt{x}}\frac{e^y}{y}dy.$ Then $f'(x)=\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2x}-\frac{e^x}{x}.$ and so
$xf'(x)=\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2}-e^x.$
The required integral is $I=\int_0^1 f(x)dx.$ Apply By Parts
by considering $u=f(x)$ and $dv=dx$ to get
 $I=(1f(1)-0f(0))-\int_0^1(\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2}-e^x)dx.$
To find the first integral, use the u-substitution $u=\sqrt{x}$
and the integration By Parts again!

These lectures is too simplified because proof used in lecture is not completely done.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Really this lecture deserves a bow 🙏 from india, thank you for clear explanation sir

oh I can't stop this class, I watch it all night.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am going to put short 5 minutes clips that will be kind of a 'cliffs notes' to each lecture in this series on my channel 

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Cool hwip

Bohdan Nazarenko
0 seconds ago
I wish there were 4k cameras back then in order to shot this beauty well!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
the third pivot is 3, not 5 as shown in the example. Interestingly, in back substitution -6 yielded a -2 for z as did the -10 that was shown

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
i wish there would have some full system tap of Mathematical analysis and Physics courses 😁

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Ax=b, then AtAx=Atb. awesome!

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
15 years later, but the cameraman did not do a good job on this particular lecture. Most of the time the camera was too far zoomed in to see all of the notes on each blackboard slide. Previous lectures did a much better job of zooming out to see the full picture.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
"if one of those is the zero vector, *INDEPENDENCE IS DEAD* "

not the context i expected those dramatic words in

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
31:19 shouldn't that read dy/dt = 10cos(10) because x=10t   =>   x' =10?


Or have I missed something?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This man is brilliant. A brilliant professor who conveys the true art of teaching. Happy to see this.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
looks like he has memorized the whole lecture instead of letting it come naturally

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Xo = at the intersection of the Y and X axes. He should have used an other symbol or letter whatever.

I love this guy. Been watching him for years. I am out of the business ( Ex teacher) and working on the railroad for a living now, however I still have an interest in math and science. Dr. Strang is the Eddie Vedder of math.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Is there an error at 32:30? Shouldn't S be multiplied before (lamda matrix)^100?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

I don't understand clearly if x≠x_0 why we find the answer f'(x_0).(x-x_0=0. ? Can someone explain me?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I'm very thankful for these lectures. Though, the camera movement is sometimes annoying.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Dear God,

Thank you for Gilbert Strang

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Cool. Waterloo University has very similar lectures. This one is very clear though and I can understand the professor.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
This guy is something else. I go to my Linear Algebra class and I usually go out feeling more confused than when I went in, then I come watch these videos and things make sense in a minutes. It's not just what he knows, but he knows how to explain it, simple brilliant.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

lol, in france we do that at 15 years old.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Single variable calculus (aka Calculus I and II) is equivalent to AP Calc AB and BC.

In AB, there is material from Calc I and a bit from Calc II. In BC, the material revisits Calc I to some extent (that's why there's a B in the course names AB and BC) and then covers the Calc II material. 

Calculus III (multivariable) is not covered in high school because most students don't reach that far (the ones that do might take a special class or they enroll in a college class while in high school).

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I don't know what he's doing differently, but everything is easier when I listen to this guy. It might be the way he repeats certain phrases or makes everything less abstract. I'm currently struggling in my Linear Algebra class, so seeing this video and realizing that it isn't as hard as my current professor makes it seem is a huge relief. This guy is great. Thanks MIT. 

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
I think my mind just exploded !

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
m is a number of rows, and the column space is in R^m?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
33:35 three rules

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
At 20:36 , I got bit confused and did not understand what was the point Prof.Gilbert made.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I don’t need to take linear algebra in college but it’s 3 am and here I am 1 full lecture deep too late to stop now

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
it is very nice lecture i appreciate his hard work

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
OMG!
Amazing teaching!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This document https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/1.-vectors-and-matrices/part-c-parametric-equations-for-curves/session-17-general-parametric-equations-the-cycloid/MIT18_02SC_notes_9.pdf has an equation for an ellipse.  Is it correct?

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder if Stoke's theorem generalizes well to even higher, say, n, dimensional space.  

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Its much easier to think of elimination as the needed row operations in order to produce a reduced row-echelon or at least a row-echelon form !

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Outstanding--Review on June 11th

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Also a great explanation by Gilbert Strang

I think Prof. Strang forgot to mention his (the) "secret ingredient": to love to teach. 
I hope he keeps sharp and healthy for a long time to come!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Finally  null space  column has a combination of  identity  with free  variables 👏👏

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT students groaning about a Taylor series expansion on a course in multivariable calculus? I don't know how a lot of these students made it into MIT.

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
No, ImageNet is just a training data. It consists of a bunch of pairs of image and description in words of what's in the image. It has nothing to do with neural networks, other than the fact that CNNs are currently the best tools to do image classification, and thus to win ILSVRC challenges.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
OK I've watched this. How am I going to use this in the real world. 

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Here we are anyhow finding the best approximated solution by this method. 
Then why can't we find the same approximated solution even when the rank(A) < n.  By following the same way. 
Just by projecting the 'b' on C(A) and then solving.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Yeah.. but everyone forgets stuff and some people catch on faster than others. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
in the elementary matrix, How we can know the unknown column otherwise (same columns ) which take 100 or 010 or 001   
I really do not understand how he knows this for example, in minute 31:40 
how can he determine that third row should be (0 -2  1 )

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
All the presentations by this lecturer is excellent,and well presented for taking notes and to learn by  listening.Well paced .

be nice to have American teachers in American classrooms. I find myself too distracted trying to decipher the accent when my attention should be on the material. 

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's so sad that the camera work is so bad, he's a really good lecturer, so it's frustrating to pause everywhere to take notes. My teachers are nowhere near this standard.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
im 17 and doing this in school...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is everyone here so old?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What kind of alien language is this? 

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
About pi. I find it funny that people say that one can calculate the periphery of a circle but not of an ellipse when the periphery of circle is 2*pi*r and ellipse is 4*a*E(e), where r is the radius of the circle, a is the larger semiaxis of the ellipse and e is the excentricity of the ellipse. pi and E(e) are both as difficult to calculate exactly but somehow people say that the other equation is explicit and the other is not.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
function👎

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
thinking about subspaces of matrices is difficult i couldn't even visualize

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
n^2 + (n-1)^2 + (n-2)^2 + ... + 2^2 + 1^2 = n * (n+1) * (2n + 1) / 6. As n becomes "big", this sum approaches n^3 / 3. His approach in the lecture is also good. Plot a graph of y = x^2 and identify the points x = n, x = n-1, x = n-2, ..., x = 1, and you'll find that if n is big enough, the discrete plots start to look more and more like the curve y = x^2, which then allows you to approximate the area under the curve. Again, what you get for a reasonably large n is n^3 / 3. One final thing is, if these operations are performed in a loop, you'll need way more time, because his analysis assumes an operation on an entire row. To achieve this, you would need vectorized code that can operate on the entire row at once. Hope this helped someone :)

### 25. Classical Inference III
Thank you Professor Tsitsiklis for this great intro to Probability!

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Glad mit still needs sat score to admit students or they would be ruined.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT students, first year.

fuck are you on?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mit lectures are futile.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've been working on the problem sets for these lectures on the MIT website, but it doesn't seem to give solutions for the part B problems; does anyone know where I could find these? 

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So students at MIT also make noises & talk with each other when the instructor turns his back towards students.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
Whelp. He's right that he's staying home and not driving around this year.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Why take linear algebra if you're not interested?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
in 30:10 question we can calculate the area of the triangle simple by using 1/2 * base*height and its a right angled triangle so is it necessary to use calculus over here.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Gilbert Strang, you have my love. I love you. The devotion you show for the subjects you teach is rare. One can easily see why an institution like MIT would like to keep you for the rest of your life. Thank you.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Unique and interesting presentation. However, would be difficult if one had not already had basic LA.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
He explained in 1 lecture what took my professor 3.... very good teacher

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Thank you sir,  I understand the importance of checking triangular inequalities. By the way isn't the Distance Matrix  1st row [ 0 1 6], 2nd row [ 1 0 1] and 3rd row  [6 1 0].

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks a lot to Dr. Auroux and all the staff behind the making of this series of videos. The course is very insightful and clear. By going through these videos, I cleared up a lot of confusions which were unanswered when I took the course before.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
good question

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does this class include what is generally Calc 2 as well? I see the next class up is multivariable which is often known as calc 3 at some uni's.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Professor Auroux!

oops wrong video

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get it. Don't take it wrong, but why is this course offered? These students got in so they have the grades. AP Calc AB/BC is taught as a junior or senior class.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It  is flux ACROSS the surface.. (hence it's integrated over F.n) means that flux is maximum when the normal vector of the surface is parallel to the vector field.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow - the ending was just mind blowing!!! Think I am starting to love Mathematics so much

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Oh man still confused on how P intersection L is a subspace I mean I get that their intersection will be 0 which is a sub space but if a vector is in P subspace and another vector is in W subspace how their sum and multiplication will be in that intersected subspace.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yes, it's still harder than the very first lecture at high school tho

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Any prerequisites for this course?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I already bought this book and I can’t wait😍😍😍

### 34. Final Course Review
I can't thank you enough, Dr. Strang! :) It's been a wonderful semester.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sorry to burst your ego but that's really high school level mathematics, and he even explained it in the video.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dr. Strangelove!!!!!!
please say: "I can walk it's a miracle!"

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I dont understand... I am really dumb to be in MIT but what the heck is going on with these students... they shouldn't be getting confused over simple shit as that, can someone tell me are MIT students really not that smart as people say?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]mal profesor, explica las ecuaiones de forma mecanica, es mejor aprender en la casa.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Professor Suvrit Sra, thank for a beautiful lecture on Stochastic Gradient Descent and it's impact on machine learning.  This powerful lecture help me understand something about machine learning and it's overall impact on large companies.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thank youthank you very muchI will donate

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
nice lectures , very helpful to me an indian student

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
No one calculate the determinant as it is defined, but using some matrix decompostion, like AR=QU or PA=LU. This way, the determinant is in the diagonal of U, less than a change of sign.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
These are very niece explanation of Linear Transformations and  Their Matrices  thanks once again to the godfather of linear DR. Gilbert Strang. I took introductory linear algebra at the University of Maryland Baltimore County  in the late 1980's and my professor was nothing close to what Dr. Strang is. This MIT legend is a rare find.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I have used the Kirchhoff's Law for 6 yrs since studied electrical engineering, and that's the first time I learn it from perspective of matrices, what a great lecture!

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
cos^4 (theta) could be integrated by using Wallis formula its easier :) 

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I think I need my subspace radio.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
The author of Mathematics for the Million was Lancelot Hogben in 1936. Eric Temple Bell wrote Men of Mathematics in 1937. For decades, both were very popular books on math for the general audience back when computational cost meant paying people to crank mechanical devices and write down the answers. Now a smartphone can invert a giant matrix in the blink of an eye.

he does it not as if he's doing math, but like art, like poetry

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
is he the best mathmatician of our times ?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Great professor

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I could understand this but am dumb ☹️

### 18. Properties of Determinants
@[USERNAME]
he explains that if you multiply only one row! so he did it correct

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
God bless MIT and Professor Strang. Such a bright light for a wonderful course!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Psh, that example had a much easier solution. Just multiply the first two equations, cancel the xy (as clearly neither can be 0), and you get L^2 = 4.

Glad to finally learn Lagrange Multipliers, though; my teacher skipped over them in AP Calc, so they've always seemed like some magical algorithm I would never know that trivially solves optimization problems.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Look. I’m going say this. I learned much oh this in Pre-Calculus in 1981 👍🏾

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
thanks

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
and the paradox lies in the very nature of curvature itself, which can't be exactly calculated using discrete math (I am claiming the entire real number line is discrete).

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I have a doubt/conclusion that needs rectification as I am no sure about  it. So here it goes. If 2 matrices A and B (both nxn) have the same 4 subspaces then if they are spanning all of n dimensional space(in form of Column and Row Spaces i.e. all cols and rows are independent or rank = n), only then can A and B not be multiples of each other.  If they span a subspace of the column space Example 2D plane in R³, then in that case A and B have to be multiples of each other i.e. A=cB. Am I correct? Pls justify or oppose my conclusion. Thanks for reading :)

Am here as a Graduate student who is up for a Behavioral economics interview in two weeks and i need some Econometric analysis background led me here as a foundation and am not even mad.. the Professor is just amazing.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
student sitting in mit and no doubt really talented student but got stuck at simple point which is like 7th grade question

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
와...

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Around #22:30 , why not just do the multiplication by distributing in order, i.e. 
(a+b+c)(d+e+f) = ad+ae+af+bd+be+bf+cd+ce+cf 
instead of what he called "cross-terms?"


### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I remember in a lecture he suddenly stops for a few seconds then exclaims 'Wait a minute! there's a minus sign here!' It was a funny moment.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thanks Prof. Strang.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I am not able to understand how the matrix A is being formed from X and result. Please help

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
30:54 I think he made a mistake when drawing the curve. The top is not matching.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Thanks professor, Thanks MIT.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
What a beautiful beautiful lecture! 

Thank you Prof. Suvrit!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How is his proof for dot product not circular logic? If you believe the law of cosines... then that is a proof for the dot product. If you believe in the dot product, then that's proof for law of cosine. WTF?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Glad the intro properly says "high quality" rather than the illiterate "quality" so often used now  to describe the video which follows.. At least there is one place left which respects   language. MIT is to be commended for this alone.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He was explaining that you could factor them out, but that would take to long to factor out the 10th power.  That's why he didn't actually do it, he showed the rule.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much! God bless you!

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
This give a easiest geometric interpretation of why singular matrices has no inverse. This kind of matrices take n-dimensional vectors as input and the output is in a vector of smaller dimension, and different vectors can have the same output, so you can´t have an inverse transformation because you don't know to wich of all of this original vectors corresponds the vector in the space of smaller dimension. More importat, that's why you need an initial condition in integrals to know the original function, because the derivative is making this same process and only with the inverse ('integral ) you can't tell which is the original function.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone explain the proof starting at 5:45?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Linear algebra is used quite frequently in the real world. Especially when countless variables are being dealt with. Computer programs/software are great examples of this.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Homie, you are not alone.  Having said that, many questions tend to go away with time.  Sometimes you just go through the motions, as it were, now, and hope that deeper understanding evolves later, even much later.   If this stuff was intitive (some of it is,) it wouldn't have taken them 1000 years to 'discover' the Calculus.  

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lec 27 is so interesting

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
42:00 Are the things he's saying correct or he was confusing the words "potential" and "potential energy" during the whole lecture? Shouldn't force be a gradient of potential energy and electric field intensity a gradient of electric potential?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There's a very specific notation for the junk xD

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]We'll these courses go by so quickly there barely enough time to understand all the material let alone really appreciate what you're learning. The instructor and educational institution realize that because of the pace of these courses you won't be able to develop a concrete understanding at the same pace. They want to know that you have a fairly well-off foundation and really developing a strong usages of these concepts will be your problem later.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Thanks sir!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why audio is muted

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've just noticed that my teacher never taught me the entire steps...just the short cuts. This is great!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
27:30 oh my god it makes sense

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
29:33 should be  you can find a non-zero vector x with Ax=0

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Damn, the explanation to the quadratic approximation is simple but powerful. I just took the CFA Level 1 exam, and the Bond Duration involved such quadratic approximation and I have been wondering where tf was that extra 1/2 coming from. At the end of the day, It was all my own insufficient knowledge in fundamental calculus. I wished I had studied my undergrad in MIT. But it's never too late to study, thank you MIT for the free education.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'm confused to the extent that i don't know what i'm confused about. ( probably  i'm missing something)

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
if I put in 3,3,7. That would be a goof

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Does he talk somewhere about vector spaces, subspaces, euclidian spaces ?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This comments thread seems to be filled with people reassuring themselves of their intelligence even though MIT rejected them. If you were actually doing multivariable calculus in 6th grade, you wouldn't be complaining on a youtube thread. 

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you professor Gilbert Strang. This lecture's content is very abstract, thank to the previous lectures that helped me to build up foundation knowledge and intuition that I could understand this lecture.

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
Gilbert Strang, you have done so much to help me learn linear algebra for my research. Thank you!!

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I find this course especially a great one. Probably many people will argue that it seems easy, the professor speaks slowly, many concepts are probably studied in high school, and is worried about the critical points in his explanation. And that's the point.. In one of this lectures the students asks more questions than in the complete calculus course I took in mi Spanish university 25 years ago. 
In my course the professor took for granted much concepts that we didn't had, taught for himself (he was a mathematician of course, but we were studying chemistry..), worried more of finishing the lesson in time (at full speed) without taking into account the main key points of confusion a first year college has. I know there's a more theoretical (for mathematicians) courses of calculus in MIT, more formal and pure mathematics, but this is the best calculus course a first year college should have.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
useful for understanding mathematics

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
The comments are always much consolation to see...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Great prof..he makes linear algebra makes more sense, and easier to understand..I mean it is suppose to be easier..the purpose of linear algebra is to make complex thing easier to solve...but unfortunately many teachers dont teach it properly, making it seem so hard to learn

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
He's absolutely amazing!!!

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Prof Boyd is also very good teacher !
I enjoy his lecture very much.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Took me some time to realize he was talking about the American version of 'football'.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Well, if you watched until 2:30 you would of heard that it is used in "Science, Engineering, Political Science and Economics" but clearly since you dont understand that, i doubt you understand differentiation in its simpliest form.


### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Wow just amazing,in 2 and a half minute, u generalized my concept and the use of the dot product was astonishing, hats off professor🙇‍♂️🙇

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Oh God, not another chalk on the blackboard presentation. This is the 21st Century.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Someone have more clear resource (Lecture videos) that explain everything without skipping some points because i really can't understand this 
can someone please send my some link or something that explain better?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Watching Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, came here to understand what a low rank matrix factorization is.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Thank you

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lagrange multipliers. Ouch. Starting to make a bit of sense now, but it would have been good if he could have done a different example, preferably one that didn't use up time talking about pyramids and triangles; time that could have been spent going over the actual Lagrange multiplier method again a bit more slowly.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In italian calculus courses there are better proofs for limits sinx/x=1 and (cosx-1)/x=0... here the explanation is very confused, and in particular how can I say that the limits would be 1 and 0 and not, for example, 0.99 and 0.01? We use instead the theorem of comparison for the first limit (sin x < x < tan x) and a trick for the second limit (1-cos x = 2sin^2(x/2)). Very simpler and clearer.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Eigen vector direction may change between the same and opposite directions  but the eigen value may be increased as a conclusion message of professor.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Around 21:00,.In general case of R^n, you can not form a determinant of A and B unless n=2. Hmmm 

### Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series
Great topic!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
@[USERNAME]You are right. I did not knew what will happen next and hence was kind of anticipating things. But now I know that I was right


### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In 20:17 .. if the prism is cube why the sum is square 1^2+2^2+3^2 ....

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
A Few days back I emailed Prof. Gilbert Strang,after completing the Linear Algebra course taught by him, showing my gratitude to him for letting us learn these amazing things in a heavenly interesting way. He, in reply, thanked me and informed me of this course. Professor, I wish I could give you my years left.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Take really good notes and absorb them. Now, try to present the same lecture without memorizing it all like a script. Not so easy, is it?! You see that Strang is not referring to notes. Keep working at it and you will have internalized the idea.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Any of these single variable calculus resently im self teaching myself math and looking for the best software to follow up, I have a pdf on the subject, called by early transdentals, and there is one doing the same subject on Edx, looking for the best resources to continue my math studies. Khan academy is good but to jumpy now for my liking.i am from Scotland uk and hope I can find the right ones.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Beware! Storytelling is enticing enough to make you jump to next one like it's GOT

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I'm so gonna forget all the homeworks I've done in this course (because it makes me learn how to compute rather than actual knowledge, I'll still remember the "knowledge" in the lecture though) 

Confusing part: 
0:00 what does that linear problem really mean? (Why is the solution only u(t) when there're 2 variables u1 and u2? Shouldn't it be u1(t) and u2(t) Maybe that some calculus that I don't know yetf) 
9:55 (Au popping off like a wild Pokemon)
18:48 (What is that value, sine and cosine thingy and why? Maybe that's some calculus problem that I should just agree that it is for now) 

I heard about Taylor series 
Is (1-x)^-1 = 1 + x + x^2 +... true with every x? 
Oh, here's the answer :

why do they laugh at the chain?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Legend

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
3:07 Why does elimination change the column space? All you do is take rows to be linear combinations of each other (crucially, preserving the original row), which leaves the column space unchanged. The basis vectors you use to form the column space are different, but the space itself should be the same because all combinations are in the original space and no vectors are lost by multiplication by zero.

### 34. Final Course Review
thank you Professor Gilbert Strang for these wonderful lectures.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Best discussion on Baye's, I have come across.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank's MIT, now I don't have to go to my lectures any more! :) 

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
“Why don’t we learn all Linear Algebra in one lecture? - We just live so long ...” - Gilbert Strang is transmitting and implanting big ideas with Love. 🙏 Students are so lucky to be in his presence - of the real master. And we are lucky to watch it years later... 🙏

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just to add, I'm glad I've got YouTube where I can pause video so brain can catch up. I'd fail the course if I was actually at MIT and had to keep up in real-time :)

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pre-calculus is a great conglomeration of advanced algebra and logical extensions, and is a great buildup to calculus, but usually does not contain concepts or calculations of calculus within itself.

### 34. Final Course Review
The beauty of these lecture can't be described in words. It was best 45 days of my life. Hope to take other courses of Dr Strang too.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thank You 
Education without politics

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lazy teaching

### 15. NP-Completeness
What's the difference between verify and test? Seems to me they are not quite different...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Take for example something as simple as the circle.  The length of the perimeter/circumference can never be exactly known, since it relies on the product of the length of straight line and an irrational number--it can only be approximated to whatever precision one desires.  Until infinity is more fully understood and embraced in a type of mathematics that allows for continuous exactitude, we are left with the limit.

### Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...

regarding the mono audio issues, if you are on W10 you can search ''ease of access'' -> ''audio'' and turn on ''mono audio''.
it will work properly that way. (remember to turn it off afterwards)

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Thank professor, such a great joy to watch your lecture <3

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
35:00 This is like a typical home work quiz problem.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I really find it funny how towards the end of the lecture most students can't wait to go..😂

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Yes Dr Rodriguez, thousands of people will listen to the your lecture. Thank you for the lectures! Must be more awkward if you imagine yourself lecturing to number of people that is of stadium size.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
You could also argue that it isnt a basis because -1 time the first vector plus 2 times de second vector gives us the third vector... You really dropped the ball there professor G. hahahaha just kidding, this man is the best thing that ever happened to Linear Algebra right after Gauss

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally completed this course !! Thank You, MIT:)

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Thank you very much for these lectures. They are very useful!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This is the statistics class we actually wanted to take but didn't get.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
So at 35:23, does that mean that every Vector Space in R^2 must pass through the origin (0,0)

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I was nodding my head, keeping up just swimmingly, it all made perfect sense.  He wrapped up the diagram and it seemed like we were done.  Then he stepped over to the far board and replaced vectors with matrices and just turned everything upside down.  Didn't see that coming.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
that has to be the best damn chalk ever

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I always found it interesting how the US system of teaching calculus has evolved into two subjects - calculus and real analysis. I guess the motivation for calculus is to introduce some of the concepts and build the practical skill of calculating derivatives, integrals and apply them to analysis of functions and generally solving practical problems. The rigorous introduction of the subject is left to real analysis which I guess not all students learn. For me, analysis became clear once I looked into how the subject developed over time, how Newton/Leibniz saw the connection between the derivative and the integral. I always wondered why all those people were so busy with calculating areas and why the tangent was something they were interested in. Also, the limit process always looked as a cheat until the moment someone suggested it was a best approximation, the way to do away with infinity and replace it with the nearest best approximation. Just wondering if calculus presented in such a form rises more questions than it answers.. I guess the joy of applying the method to different problems overshadows the gaps here and there..

Do you guys learn about this in 10th grade? I don't know about your system because I'm an Indian and we learnt this before college. Why are they teaching this in MIT tho? Like you guys do study variable calculus before college right? I'm genuinely curious.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
In closure in concat, why we don't know where to split?
x is a string in M1, so it has a finite length. Then I think the end of the string x must be the split point.

### 4. Counting
His lecture is not fast, quite helpful for non-native speakers.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I enjoyed this lecture.  Professor Strang seems like a congenial person truly interested in imparting his knowledge.  Some professors seem to look down on their students and have the attitude that if you don't get it, tough.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Probability was a very difficult math course when I was in university which was made even harder by the professor who taught it. At least now, I can appreciate the subject more.

So good for doing this, even it's ordinary. Very good self-study material.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Am I the only one who doesn't seem think mr jerison isn't a good teacher? I mean compared to the brilliant herbert gross and christine breiner he seems to not be able to connect with us students and get what might be difficult or need more to students. In one of the lectures he couldn't even understand that the student who asked a question had a problem with negative numbers n that's the freakin basics .. PS I totally get this a purely subjective thing.

@[USERNAME]ok, so whats better about a black board vs. a smart board, you can make a smartboard look like a black board. you can scan every thing on a smart board and  send your lecture notes to students via email. you can plug your calculator into a smart board and show your students what you are doing. you can even re-do and un-do mistakes like on paint or photoshop, yes smart boards are the best.

### 3. Parametric Inference
This Lecture seems to be somewhat lacking in examples and illustrations.

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Amazing limited edition 👍🏻

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Excellent lecture, great visual and conceptual explanations, much appreciated!

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
I think (but am not necessarily sure) that positive definite matrices can have non orthogonal eigen vectors. Symmetric matrices can definitely have non orthogonal eigen vectors.

Posted this as a reply to a comment but reposting it here:

Symmetric matrices don't necessarily require the eigenvectors to be orthogonal, I think the same is also applicable to positive definite matrices.

Consider the identity matrix for example. It can be decomposed into a product of a non orthogonal matrix of two arbitrary (but independent) eigen vectors the the lambda matrix (identity) and the inverse of the first matrix.

It would be great if someone could confirm the same about positive definite matrices.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you. it has been fun and love prof Strang humour.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Globaly very Great lecture (19/20), congratulations.
But I notice at 34:30 nevertheless a great confusion, between VECTOR SPACE and AFFINE SPACE. Actualy, the 0 vector MUST indeed be in all vector spaces BUT has NO FIXED "PLACE" in the plane. The word "place" is in fact irrelevant for a vector in general and the 0 vector in particular. It is a beast that doesn't live in the affine plane, and so has no "location" in it. That's a crucial point. A dual way of painting this need understanding that the affine origine has indeed fixe coordinates, namely (0,0), ok, BUT it's location in the plane is ARBITRARY (by homogeneity argument somehow) so as the "orientation" of the axes (by isotropic argument somehow).
For similar reasons the straight line OF the origine is NOT LESS a vector space than the one THROUGH the origine. And even much more than that. In fact these two affine lines are EQUIVALENT AFFINE REPRESENTATIONS of the SAME 1-dim vector space which is, by definition, essentialy a DIRECTION (their comon one), and THAT IS what matters. It may seem to beginers that this confusing situation is a paradox. In fact, NOT AT ALL. Nevertheless, to overcome it, it is crucial to understand that a 1 dim vector space is NOT in fact an (affine) straight line (not more the one THROUGH the affine origine than the one OF the affine origine) BUT essentialy a DIRECTION, that is to put it in a rather intuitive and visual formulation, an EQUIVALENT CLASS of infinitely many parallel (all pointing in the same direction) affine straight lines filling the entire plane (in 2 D).
"Complementary" the ZERO VECTOR is "LOCATED" NO WHERE in particular in the affine plane. In fact it doesn't live in it BUT in the infinite family of infinite equivalent classes. To visualize it one could think of it through a pedagogical metaphore of a strange being : an ISOTROPIC "1 dim" vector space, that is, a strange "line" pointing in all direction equivalently, which is an impossible mission except for a degenerate line reduced to a point. Any affine point can be seen as a equivalent representation of the 0 vector pointing in NO DIRECTION.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
can someone please let me know of the prerequisites before starting if you have already seen the course.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I think the error in 9th lesson was intentional, because this mistake makes you realize that for independence you can look both columns and rows.

Hooray and big ups to MIT for publishing these high quality videos!

Anyone else notice the professor alternates between solid red, blue, green shirts throughout the semester?  hehe.

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Hi, Thank you for these nice videos.

One small note : at 27:40, I think that to justify the use of uniform distribution for θ, one should use entropy, so given that uniform distribution (discrete r.v)/Guassian (continious r.v with a given 1st and 2nd moments) has the highest entropy, i.e the highest degree of randomness, if we estimate/detect θ assuming those distributions, the solution would be the best (in randomness sense, so lower probability of error maybe ?) also for other distributions based θ, given that those other distributions have lower degree of randomness.

Cheers
Nabil

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Solution time: Sometimes we can't solve Ax=b but we can solve the nearest solution that is what projection do.
But what is the link between vector b and the projection vector p, it's perpendicular. Then if b doesn't lie in the column subspace of A which will cause no solution, then we can think that the null space is also perpendicular to the column space of A. So p is in null space. Then go back to the original problem to calculate the nearest solution we just need to multiply the A' on both sides.
because A'(b-Ax)=0 where b-Ax finds the A' null space, we just need to solve A'b=A'Ax. Done!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I wish they would not start packing up and making noises when Professor Strang didn't even finish his last sentence...They should've known how lucky they were to have this education :)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
After years of using linear algebra, both in fundamental problem formulation, and in numerical computation, I can say that Prof. Strang's approach to teaching the subject is by far the most direct, comprehensible, practical, satisfying, and even beautiful pathway into the subject. In particular he makes front and center key nuggets often ignored or insufficiently emphasized, such as the column picture, the fundamental vector spaces of a matrix, the big, must-see  factorizations of a matrix, and even a most satisfying way of looking at least squares. Going through his lectures, I learned a lot of wonderful things that fell through the cracks during my education.

I learned a lot with your videos, they are fantastic. I could not believe that one can watch Legendary Professor Gilbert Strang.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Less Steep" was a bit of a confusing word to describe a straight line.

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
Professor Strang ,this is an awesome lecture on the Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values using  derivatives from calculus. Students should have a solid understanding of calculus before taking upper level mathematics.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
So, that's the reason for the row versus the column combinations! I could've used this concept in late 1976.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:58 You don't get M back from ∂M/∂y in cases where M is the sum of a function of x only and another function since you lost all information of how M depends on x only (for example M = x+y, ∂M/∂y = 1, integrating 1dy will never give M back). However, you do get back M(x, f2) -M(x, f1) because what depends only on x cancels out.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Thanks for these lectures and for the effort in putting together these videos!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

I'll be covering all the relevant lectures of Calculus. Thanksa lot :-)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hrm, turned into quite the meaty flamewar.
I do indeed feel stuck in the middle. :)

@ thejugglenaut:  It's probably why I learn best self taught.  Also being a visual thinker, it's sometimes difficult to make a brain painting of certain concepts.  It's especially bad when it comes to applying new material.  Really have to drive the nail deep with cement, epoxy and duct tape to get it to stick.  Takes time to work out a memorable picture.

The third world countries graduates needs to work more inorder to compensate the difference in concepts with developed countries graduates.
Thank you very much...


### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If Taylor's approximation is valid only for small theta, why would we use it here. Since theta increases by 2*pi by every rotation, we can no longer use this approximation. So instead of this, can't we just use dy/dx to find out the nature of cycloid? Is this correct?

He is lecturing to an empty classroom if you look at time 40'53'' !! Even more wonders!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've heard so many silly (from my subjective point of view) questions coming from students about "differentiability => continuous" theorem proof. I just don't understand why MIT students are not familiar with basics of maths. But really... How many people in comments did not understand his proof? I'm just curious, because my hypothesis is that everyone here understood him. Am I wrong?

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
15:00 xDDD everyone clapping

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I have huge respect for him, he teaches in a way to make the subject interesting.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did anyone else find the premise of the financial question at the end confusing? It seems like he didn't define the function or defined it as something weird like you borrow 1 dollar on day 1 2 on day two, etc... but never really said that.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Can anyone please explain how the dimension of symmetric matrix is 6?  (at 6:43). I understood we have have 3 diagonal basis, but I do not understand how we get the other 3... [100;000;000], [000;010;000], [000;000;001] is all I can think of now... how the other basis can be a symmetric?

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What if the second derivative in the denominator evaluated at the critical point equals zero...?

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks a lot.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you professor Strang for the excellent lectures. I think watching all of your lectures on youtube (of course if you are not enrolled at MIT, in that case you could register for 18.06) is THE best way to learn Linear Algebra!

I particularly liked the way you explain using examples and always help us have the big picture, even when we are discussing something specific. You're a great teacher!

### 14. Graph limits I: introduction
Excellent hand writing!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I feel so lucky to be able to pause, rewind, and re-watch.  I might have struggled trying to take notes while letting the incredible insights sink in.  Are we getting a better education online than even the students in this very course?!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
It's fun pausing the video and trying to figure out how the process ends before he's shown it ...

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
That exercise at the end did not come out to have average of 67.5 and Std dev of 18....is it me or did t happen with anyone else

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you G.Strang!
Anyone from Siraj's video?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Having a competent instructor teach undergraduate mathematics is a key differentiator in college.   Most often undergraduate courses will be taught by either the the incompetent, the unskilled, or by poor communicators.  Often all three in combination.    Requiring your best instructors to indoctrinate the freshmen is seen as a waste by many as the drop out rate is high and the lectures are trivial.   Sadly this logic reinforces high drop out and trivial lectures.    My calculus 1 course had a 50% drop out rate and then a 50% failure rate.   The lecturers generally could not speak English, could not teach calculus, and to give them the benefit of a doubt were completely indifferent to the students (as opposed to entirely incompetent).   It  was essentially a farce.   The best strategy was to read the text, do the problems and attend the labs.   The classes were not worth attending.

The Socratic method was generally not seen till late in the 4rth year when it was far to late to salvage most students from rote memorization and pandering to professors idiosyncrasies.   MOOC's have opened up an opportunity for learning that exceeds the abilities of most universities to provide.    Industry has yet to recognize this,  Universities have yet to recognize this, but there are avid students around the world that will begin to generate new science, mathematics, literature without the benefit of an Ivy league education or even a piece of paper recognizing their accomplishments.

There is a massive barrier to publish based on pedigree that has to be overcome and the establishment is highly motivated to maintain these barriers for as long as they can to protect  themselves but it is likely to come down fairly quickly once there is a critical mass of globally educated students producing meaningful outputs.

... or at least this is my hope.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 44:00, can someone please explain to me where does he get the 2 from?. I understand that the x^1 comes from x^{n-n+1}, but the 2 that he adds?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
that's a dumb explanation for the name chain rule. that got an applause ?!!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
@[USERNAME]What does he meant lambda comes from here? Why does it come from the variance of the limit distribution? After this, where does the next expression come from, the one he divides lambda by, why does he do this?

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
hahhaah 29:53 "i think of matrices as people at this point". As we approach the end of the course, i just want to thank you AGAIN, amongst the plethora of other appreciations. This have been a remarkable journey, I dont think any other lecturer in the entire world would have made this as enjoyable as you have Mr Strang. Case-in-point: the comment at this time stamp just adds that additional layer of novelty and enjoyment that makes the whole experience just remarkable.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The good way to learn math is to do exercises.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At 28:11 ,How can we assume Nullspace to be 0,if free variables are 0,in Reduced echleon eqn=[-F I] to find nullspace F=0 as free variable is 0,But I can still write 1 in place of I to get Nullspace non zero???

15:40 Why were the second and third columns of A equal to -1 -2 -1, 0 0 0 respectively?

### 3. Independence
I think it's the first I follow a course where the teacher takes 5mn at each class to review and exemplify briefly what was done the last time. This stuff is quite easy as I already saw it in 6.042 for me, but it adds a level of clarity that is just amazing!
If any teacher sees this comment: what this guy does is a GREAT idea, borrow it! We can allways spare 5mn in a 1--hour course.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ah yes, 1+1=1²

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Just "nice sets" instead of the definition of a sigma-algebra? No mention that one must use Lebesgue integrals and not Riemann integrals in general case? I understand it's not a "theoretical" course but I didn't expect they cut corners this way at MIT too...

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I LOVE THIS GUY

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's the worst thing when teacher won't be delayed. He or she wants at all costs finishes subjects before exact date. I should have been happy that my maths lecturer reserves how much time he wants in compare to other teachers. Maths is the most important subject at technical univeristies.

It's good.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
You are a great teacher!

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
At 40:46, if b is the greatest of lower bounds, should it say b < b_0, whereas it says b ≤ b_0 for both second cases of least upper bound and greatest lower bound? I checked the notes for the lecture after and the second case; whilst using c and c_0, it says c < c_0. I wondered if it should strictly be less given c_0 or b_0 is considered the greatest lower bound.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
amazing!

Thank you MIT. Now I can learn from anywhere using my laptop or smartphone.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice lectures. Thank you for posting. The thing is I can't donate and money now cause I am poor, but if I have money in the future, I will remember to donate, and I hope others will do the same.

### 3. Independence
In the king's example in the end, shouldn't bg and gb mean the same thing since it does not matter how you have ordered them? So that according to that logic you still get 1/2 like how you had got intuitively.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is so easy to differentiate I got e^(xarctan(x))[arctan(x)+(x/(1+x^2))] in about 1 minute and this is right because I checked it on Wolfram Alpha and they are only doing it at the end of this degree level unit.I thought USA was good at education.I'm in Year 12 in the UK by the way.


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
does anyone else find this fun?? its 2:30am right now and im watching this... (i think this means i have no life) hahaa


### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
DR. Strang thank  you for a another awesome lecture on Multiplying and Factoring Matrices in linear algebra. I really enjoy this part of linear algebra.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
HELP! I think Strang might have got WRONG around 05:40. I think P U L is a SUBSPACE of P as P & L itself is a subspace of P.

Think like this: let p & l be a vector from P & L respectively. than u=p+l belongs to
P U L and u lies within P as p is within P and l is also within P.

Also c*p & c*l belongs to P & L respectively where c is scalar as P&L are subspace. so c*u=(c*p + c*l) belongs to P U L. 

Finally, zero vector lies in both P & L. so Zero vectors belongs to P U L.

So P U L is subspace.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
The practical application of linear algebra in real life? Thats easy: Linear Algebra is the basis for solving equations in numerical analysis. Numerical analysis uses the principles of linear algebra in order to solve systems of equations as fast as possible, as well as approximating functions, integrals, and even solving differential equations. Whats that used for? Its used in every software, every computer game, every simulation, every airplane, car, train, space shuttle etc etc etc

brilliant!! Thanks for great videos
 

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
O Conselho de Administração do PRISA (grupo que publica o EL PAÍS) aprovou os termos para o refinanciamento da dívida, que alarga o prazo até 2025 e reforça a liquidez da empresa. Ao mesmo tempo, acordou a venda do negócio de educação da Santillana de Espanha à finlandesa Sanoma por um valor do ativo de 465 milhões de euros, informou à Comissão Nacional do Mercado de Valores, órgão regulador do mercado de ações espanhol.

“Estas operações permitirão acelerar a transformação digital do Grupo, centrada nos sistemas de aprendizagem Ed-Tech, na América Latina, e nos modelos de subscrição dos seus negócios dos Média”, salienta em comunicado.

O acordo de refinanciamento da dívida prevê alargar o prazo até março de 2025, com um custo inicial de 5,5% e um custo total médio de 7% durante a vigência do contrato. Contempla a amortização de 400 milhões de dívida (ficando a dívida líquida total cortada em mais de 30%) e estabelece um marco para uma futura separação efetiva dos negócios da Educação e dos Meios de Comunicação. Com este refinanciamento, a empresa contará com cerca de 275 milhões para reforçar sua liquidez e facilitar o desenvolvimento dos planos estratégicos de negócios.

O preço pela venda da Santillana Espanha foi estabelecido sobre um valor de empresa de 465 milhões de euros, o que representa 9,6 vezes o EBITDA médio do ciclo educativo do período 2017/2019, para além dos múltiplos das principais transações comparáveis no setor. O preço será liquidado integralmente em dinheiro, na data de encerramento da operação, uma vez descontada a dívida líquida, a 30 de junho de 2020, do negócio objeto da transação, estimada em 51 milhões de euros. A venda gerarà um ganho de capital estimado em 385 milhões de euros.

O diretor-executivo do PRISA, Manuel Mirat, considera que “com estas operações, o Grupo demonstra a validade do percurso delineado, que mereceu também a confiança dos credores”. “Com a venda da Santillana Espanha, verifica-se a capacidade da PRISA de criar valor.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished (24/01/21, London), thank you very much MIT for keeping me entertained during lockdown. Both are fantastic lecturers. See you in 18.02.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
In India we study this in Kindergarden 😥😂

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
4:49 There is an error in the subtitles. Should say 'It's symmetric', not 'It's a metric'

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Thanks mit

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
mannnnnnnnnn profs. with accents...

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Is this basic statics??
I am worried that i don't understand....
Can i have the stellar ink wheee the notes and assignment are loaded

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Finally we can understand
"with respect" means
 "small changes of"
For example let find the derivative of 
the function f(x)=x+y with respect to x..
Means when x is moving slowly ..
What is the gradient between z and x
i.e 
z/x =?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
why is there no echo in my left ear?  but there is in my right ear...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow... and this is the high profile, 'first world' education??? ... goshhhh ... I learned this stuff two years before ending highschool!!, is obviously presumed to be known in order to enter university! well... I guess I'll go for Lomonov State University of Moscow... I guess this is why the USSR got first into space xD .. and what's with the exposition?!? beyond if the guy uses or not PowerPoint... it's like reading a crappy colorful textbook!!!


### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I love him so much,
He is an amiable man and he's a good teacher.  
I'm sad to see him getting old in the first video,
I hope he can live forever.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
obviously to groom your cats and dogs

### 22. Bayesian Statistical Inference II
In the linear LMS estimation part... it is nowhere mentioned that E[theta hat] = E[theta] which is a pretty important/basic property. Seems it is not in the book too (Section 8.4). I was bumping my head around proving something else... until I realized that this property holds true. Anyway... This is a perfect lecture series and I am so thankful for being able to "attend them".

This phrase really describes me fighting my procrastination all the day.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
is he even human? Beautiful!

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Fun fact: This prof started his masters leading to his Ph.D when he was 14 

:|

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
11:55 when you try to guess answer on multiply choice test

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
16:00 i love this professsor

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Thank you for existing Gilbert Strang. I am grateful to you for showing me the beauty and elegance of mathematics

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I'm struggling so much with the paradigm of linear transformations. I can do with matrices just fine. "See" the concepts even - but throw in the T(x) whateverthefuck and I can feel myelf melting with tears. Hoping this will be the click for me!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
IMPORTANT!! Make sure you have the picture quality up (preferably to 480p). Because of the length if you have the settings on auto the picture quality is very low....I was on the verge of sarcastically asking if MIT couldn't afford a decent camera!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he constantly says yesterday and tomorrow, do these guy have lessons all days ?
when do they do the homework ?!

however if they only have 1hs of calculus thats not such a pain. having 4hs x 2 days is the same pain or worse, but you can at least do the homework between these two days !

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
He's absolutely amazing! I do wonder, however, if a non MIT - like class of students would be able to appreciate his teaching style.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
(1/3)*n^3, magically! hmm! But hey, it makes sense, that is a sum of all (n-x)^2, and as he assumed for all pivots it is a continues variable then the discrete sum of continues variables turns into integral and there you have it, 1/3n^3.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Just when I thought he ran out of blackboard to write he moves to the right and lo and behold there's more of them

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
even my grandma can undestand

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Isn't the order of complexity for multiplication b/w 2 n x n matrices O(n^3) and not O(n^2)?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
so e being perpendicular to p means that e is truly the smallest difference between b and p

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I believe that Mr. Strang is really amazing and incredible, but I got stuck when he said of "the pivot and free variables" , I mean he told us about the algorithm very well, but I am not able to connect these with that what does it mean to?? Why does non pivot columns can be considered anything?? And what are its effect on my graph if I wish to plot it on?? And what's the concept behind these pivot and free variables, how did it occur from anywhere??
So , if you guys could help me out with this , it would really be appreciated!!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did he get the equation at 23:01 ?
I don't understand .
Did he differentiate with respect to ds, or what?
Please help.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

26:44 
haha thats awesome

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Who is here before world War 3

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
No news to worry. We are listening.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Aha! If wikipedia is good enough for Prof. Strang it's good enough as a source for my Master's Thesis.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Does anybody know what movie or book title he is talking about in the last minutes of the lecture at 43:47 ?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Well I got my finals in 1 month so I really hope that this will safe my ass. Complex numbers, linear algebra and differential equations in 10 weeks time, they must be nuts XD

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
32:52 ... You're welcome !

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
3 days before finishing linear algebra... I finally understand linear algebra

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I Really Like The Video From Your Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
the movement of the camera is so annoying

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you sir :)

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Awesome lectures however I call bullshit to the following: At 32:03 he says the following: "you can make it formal (the argument about the memoryless property) by just manipulating PMFs formally". And then proceeds up to 34:04 by which time he's supposedly "proven formally" the memoryless property of the geometric distribution and declares victory. Except of course he's actually proven absolutely nothing at all. Either that or I am plain thick and have failed to see the "proof".

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I am in platonic love with this teacher.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Skyrim

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
was this more difficult than previous 14 lectures?

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

thats the equation of a circle whose origin is at (a,0) and radius a

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this lecture rocks!

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
These teachings resemble those I have been seeing in Africa the difference is who studies

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Hard to find realy fat dry erase markers

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So... why do people pay to go to college? Why not just watch it on youtube, download the textbook, and take some standardized tests? No college bullshit, learn at your own rate. You could learn so much faster too.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Has to be vertically simple in all three directions.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I love Dr. Strang and rewatch his classes just to see what an accomplished teacher he is.

### 13. Regression
The camera movements are really jarring, and my eyesight isn't great so the white on grey writing is hard to read.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
dead simple, low quality, messy handwriting. Could have been explained way simpler, easier and quicker

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Super clear explanation of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Loved every minute of this video.

### 34. Final Course Review
30:46 The real joy of mathematics !! Thank you Prof. Strang :)

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
A lot of viewers here stating that they wish they had a lecturer like Gilbert. I am one of those viewers. But as a lecturer myself, I sometimes find myself in a room full of students who don't give a sh.t about anything I say or anything I explain, and it comes to a point where I want to quit my job. When you click on a link to learn math you are fully motivated. Gilbert has a full room of MIT minds who are open to learning. But when you face a group of students who are just looking for loopholes in your syllabus, who don't give a sh.t about your lessons, always fight for 0.01 points every time you conduct an exam, you began to question things. Yeah, I wish I had a lecturer like him and I am equally sorry that I cannot be a lecturer like him.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
44:10 use a diagram to replace the equation, or encoding of the equation

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
33:52 Professor Strang hasn’t taught the 18.06 for a while and he observes the lectures these days at MIT are taught in a very abstract way, unlike how he presented concepts such a column space 20 years ago. That’s why he said what’s going on? So the ‘range’ terminology of these days is the same as our good friend C(A)!

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
21:12 I believe that if c was i, the matrix is symmetric. It is complex and symmetric, while non-Hermitian.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
The key part of Zolotarev numbers explanation (sets of eigs are separate), unfortunately dosen't explain anything for me. Can anybody give a good intuition, why Zolotarev boundary works? The smoothnes at least makes sense, but while i kinda feel what Sylvester eq does, the end result is kinda deep math for me.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
What is the edition of this textbook?

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
1:38 ohh man this linear algebra series couldn't have a better ending

### 16. Markov Chains I
I love this prof

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Got B+ haaa  for class 2015

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
alright, let's talk about math, but first, I am going to give a speech like a good engineer should ... then I repeat myself over and over again, trying to get as redundant as I can ... and then I give you stuff that high school student do ... in their first year ...

I might be totally wrong saying it like this, but this is the kind of feeling I get ... In France, in "seconde", when we are 15 we learn about this. In some school, it's even earlier than that ... 

Is this video a catch-up?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Explain some wrong

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
I find these videos quite interesting, however the disorder at the time of writing that many teachers deal with bothers me. Unclear and messy handwriting. It would be nice if they could improve on those aspects.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is this lecture not being downloaded by Idm and only some of lectures of these lectures are able to be downloaded.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
mind blowing!

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guaranteed everybody watching this has a final tomorrow

greater interactive teaching than iits.here we sleep in lectures n in mit they took interest but still iitians can complete the whole courses in one nightn after that both end up with equal level

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Profesor Strang : Muchas Gracias !!!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The operation where you say 3R1-R2 i believe your R2 should (0,-2,2) not R2-3R1 (0,2,-2)
the solution is (2;1;-2)
the basic idea is to substract the row you are changing....

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Thank you, I don't get why people can't understand that Lec 1 stands for the first lecture lol


### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]it is MIT, an ivy league school and arguably the best school on the planet, its the school that Matt Damon's character went to in Good Will Hunting. I would say it is recognized as the best school among most Ivy League students but I'm not positive, there is no doubt that it is on the level of Harvard, Princeton and Tokyo University.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Worth watching and enlightening

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can you give me the link of ebook needed for the course?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
12 years later, I finally got here

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I don´t notice the identity matrix  at around @22:00

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Did you know that 93% of people make up their own statisticks?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
take speed 0.5 , it sounds like he is dissing the shit out of some1

### 18. Roth's theorem I: Fourier analytic proof over finite field
At the 1:05:30 time mark, why is it at most 4/alpha^2 steps? This seemed immediate to both the student and the prof, but I'm not seeing it.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Very much intuitive ❤️❤️❤️❤️

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Could you provide the solutions to the assignments and recitation materials?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
was the great seeing the humor come alive in this one.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Loved it so much....

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hey +MIT OpenCourseWare thanks for another amazing video. I did a short little explanation of the intuition behind FToC and would seriously love some feedback, if you get the chance. I think you might like the different approach I take. I hope so anyway :) https://youtu.be/gSA4K8xzrKc

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
At 32:00, the prove is just the component e and p equal to b. But I think the e should be perpendicular to the line, not to take the y components... i.e. at 32:00, for the proof, there is an assumption that the x component of b,e,p are the same.
Anyway, it is a great video series for review. :>

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys! Checkout 3blue1brown video on Taylor series.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I'm so grateful for his classes. Thank you, Professor!  Hugs from Brazil! =)

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
i mean why even give the free variables values and not just let them be and solve the equations, for the transpose you would just get x1=-x3 x2=-x3 and x3 as free variable, i guess im missing the point with the identity and swapping the -F but i dont really get why you want to do that instead ...

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
I hope the content of this course and a few other DL courses enables me to make a superresolution version of 18.06 video. Man I love this guy

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You are one among the best teachers sir
Great regards good health from india...

### 16. Markov Chains I
Did he just start by saying this is a lot simpler and more intuitive?? Then why did my lecturer always sound like he was from outer space???

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor miller tends to say things he doesn't mean and not realise. But I can't really judge him, as I do that a lot too.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
For a person who is not privaleged enough to study into such presitigious universities, but his courses on Linear Algebra made me fall in love with Mathematics and Computer Science. 

Sir honeslty you made my career.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
if we take the outer length, that is, d(theta).(r + dr) , then
 dA = d(theta). (r + dr) * (dr) 
       = r.dr.d(theta) + r.dr^2.d(theta)
the last term contains a square of dr, which is much smaller than dr when dr is very small itself. Hence the last term is very dispensable. 
so the first term, r.dr.d(theta) prevails.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Excellent Teacher... I learned a lot fromhim

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Why does the blackboard of a professor must be so badly made?  Why are there so many impossible to be read notes???? Could he just make it readable for his students???? I ask that because I myself had already teachers and professors that made their blackboards impossible to read and messy! Despite that detail, this interview was awesome!!!!! This man is a legend to whom may like linear algebra!!!! I myself just love it!

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
At BYU right now. Chem E.

Studying this material for the past few days now to get ahead. This lecture is an excellent tool for taking all these concepts and placing them in a clear and simple context. 

I have greatly benefited from listening to this lecture. Thank you.

### 4. Counting
Pay attention, he is one of the best profs you will ever see!

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
i don't get what is he trying to say at 43:28

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not necessarily. The only guarantee is that they know work hard and study, while Einstein's could choose to be a slacker and be going to worse colleges.

Isn't the education system America has set up great??? work your ass off for us and you will be payed! if you're smart... well no one really cares we just want you working for us.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This man is an artist.

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
my favorite anime episode so far, what a plot twist. very twisty.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand why he thinks x is fixed and "delta" x is moving in here: https://youtu.be/9v25gg2qJYE?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1&t=448
Can anybody explain me pls?

### 14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility
It is a very good series of videos, but it has a caveat. Professor Sipster seems to try to explain in detail without first giving a definite answer....

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
People, this is the fifth lecture of an introductory course to calculus, right after the freshmen are coming out of high school. It's no surprising that the teacher lays a good  foundation before moving on to more complicated things, it's a sort of equalizer for the students. To say you did this in high school doesn't prove that MIT classes are bogus, that's just a dumb statement to make.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
"So again I'm getting a little ahead because it's in section 3.2, but that's ok 🤷🏽‍♂️"

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
He looks like a reincarnation of Euler

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
To find d(A^2)/dt, we can simply write it as d(A.A)/dt and use product rule.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Ohhh Liam Neeson teaching stats.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank You, Professor and OCW for making this available.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good refreshment for my calc based physics class. Thanks MIT

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I NEED SOME SPACE AFTER THIS!!!

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
I love how confident and spontaneous Professor Strang is. He is not afraid to make mistakes in front of his students and term them as “to finish” examples for later examination as he moves forward and tries another example in hope of “doing it right” the second try. His hesitation which is a result of high brain activity may confuses you sometimes and throws you off tangent, but it emphasizes the need for continuous examination and pondering while you are presenting the material. He could to the naive critic have prepared better for his lectures to have a smoother sail, but he seems on purpose to present himself like a student who is just doing it for the first time, which is really quite sly and entertaining if you don’t find it confusing. You may for that reason have to wind back his lectures and watch it a second or even third time to get a full appreciation of his style. Thank a bunch for having such a brilliant instructor with decades of teaching and research experience!

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where are lectures: 8,17,26 and 34???

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
in which lecture has he explained the l"hospital  rule

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Why isn't the infinity application in some of these.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you, sir!!! 

It has started with a simple matrix and look it is creating the whole universe, explaining the existence. That's the beauty of it!!!
It feels amazing when I spend my time with the abstract world.
My intuition says "There is something still hiding and right now you are in the dark place so either you can't get out from that place or you can't stand still". 

Let's look at these beautiful connections:

A matrix has some columns and these are called vectors. The vectors are independent if their combinations give no zero except if they are zero vectors {How???) and dependent if the opposite of the statement is true. 
What is the connection between independence and null space and the rank of a matrix?
the vector are Independent when the Null space of that matrix = zero vector and
the rank is no of columns (Think !!!) =Invertible = nonsingular matrix.
For dependence of vectors there exists at least one free variable ( Do you know what is free variable?) and rank is less than the number of columns. ( Singular???)

The linear combination of the whole vectors forms space. (Here your existence, experience, can be explained!!! Can you visualize it in your imagination? )

The basis for a vector space is the sequence of all the vectors with two properties
1) They are independent ( look independence again comes here!!!)
2)They span a space ( what is span??? Think!!!) ( What space can be formed from these vectors (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,1)? )

The basis!!!  The children of a space!
In a three dimensional space with any two vectors, what is the basis for that space?
(Is it  a plane or a space or a line???)

Every basis for a vector space has the same number of vectors given space and that's called
the dimension of the space. The number of vectors is very important.(why??? Think!!!)

The Dimension of a column and a null space???

The dimension of the column space=The rank of matrix =Number of pivot columns. Remember, it does not depend directly on the dimension of the matrix. 

The dimension of the null space = number of columns - rank of the matrix = The number of free variables.
The basis of the column space is generated from the all the linearly independent vectors of a matrix given a space. If We know the dimension of the space then a couple of vectors that are independent be a basis.

Algorithm
1)Matrix -> row reduced echelon form->no of pivot columns->rank->dimension of column space
2) free columns = no of columns - rank= dimension of the null space.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great class, helping me a lot in Calculus III. Greetings from a studant from Polytechnique School of the University of São Paulo, Brazil!!

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
True ... the next generation will be much more intelligent than us ... because eventually every major university will be doing OCW ... and students will get to listent to so many different professors on the same subject

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
life saver for my final

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I can't expect enormous answers. Like it a lot. 

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I missed the formal definition of vector spaces. Too many references to it without writing them down. They were mentioned shortly, but...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Well don't all speak at once :)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thank you MIT , thank you professor Strang

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you a lot you are a good man to give us this barnch in mathematics

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
personal index:
def of finite automaton : 20:00
regular lang def : 29:00

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what did he say, why is Fx and Fy equal to zero in local maxima or mimima 

### 24. Classical Inference II
By the way, at 50:04 it is said that comparing the likelihood ratio L(x) with the threshold xi is the same as comparing x with the threshold xi which is not entirely true (pedantically speaking). Instead, this is true: it's the the same as comparing x with D(xi) where D is the inverse function of L(x) (since L is monotonic it has an inverse function). In other words the xi on the x axis on the drawing is not the same number as the xi from the LRT slide. Leaving this note here just for future viewers. Again: great course and professor!

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished 16/02/2021 ;DDD

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
有没有讲汉语的小伙伴

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
17:47 blows my mind that people are coming late to this class. They have NO idea how lucky they are to be at MIT and to be taught by the world's premier Linear Algebra instructor.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
hahahaha, 18:49

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This might help others trying to learn this material. 
I found it easiest to watch a few lectures, but without being overly concern about learning exactly whats going on. This gives you a basis to work from.
Then get the text book and work though it slowly. Write down the examples in the book as you encounter them and get used to forming a mental picture for whats going on. 
The column picture is key.
The row picture is probably what your school math teacher taught you. This just confused me a lot. I don't like dot products, but the "combinations of columns" is very intuitive once you can visualize why it works. 
The reason I found this easier is that the concepts introduced in the videos are a bit loose, its just an overview. The real learning comes from the text book.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Good contents. But I don't think he has a very systematic way to interpret things. It's kind of hard to understand what he is trying to say.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
This si such a treasure. Thank you so much.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I study Computer Engineering at IPN in Mexico and I'm taking Linear Algebra after this summer. I can't believe I just found these videos, It's like taking a course at MIT! There's no way I could fail that course now. Thank you for sharing this helpful information.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish he was my teacher :(. He explains things so clearly and thoroughly! 

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at minute  19:30 what if the function was not (1/ 1 + c) but more complex function where its hard to find the minimum value and the maximum value 

should we then sketch the curves and find out how the function looks like and  then find the max and min value for the function

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i am iranian and i watch this study , it was good

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
my right ear feels wholly educated

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
00:00-03:00
Review

03:00-10:00
Finding the component of a vector in the direction of a unit vector using dot product

10:00-24:10
Determinant in 2D
det(a,b) = |a| |b| sin(theta)
det(a,b) = +- area of parallelogram formed by a and b

det(a,b) = | a1 a2 | = a1*b2 - a2*b1
                  | b1 b2 |

24:10-32:45
Determinant in 3D
det(a,b,c) = | a1 a2 a3 |
                    | b1 b2 b3 |
                    | c1 c2 c3 |
det(a,b,c) = +- volume of parallelepiped formed by a, b, c

32:45-47:00
Cross product is a vector, only defined in 3D
a x b = |  i    j    k  |
            | a1 a2 a3 |
            | b1 b2 b3 |
Cross product is perpendicular to the plane formed by a and b
Length of cross product is area of parallelogram formed by a and b
Right hand rule

47:00
Volume of parallelepiped using triple product instead of determinant

Triple product 
a dot (b x c)

det(a,b,c) = a dot (b x c) = +- volume of parallelepiped

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
What a superb Professor.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
how is the number of operations n^2. 
2x2 ----> 1 operations
3x3 ------>1+2=3 operations
4x4 -------> 3+3=6 operations
5x5-------->6+4=10 operations
6x6--------->10+5 = 15 operations
7x7---------> 15+6 = 21 operations


So it should be 1+2+3+4+5+6+.....n = n(n+1)/2 
Correct me if I am wrong

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah mate, let me tell you something, where I live we don't have AP classes, so here we only learn calculus in college, well I'm not yet in college, I've just finished highschool and I'll start my first year in college in 2 months, and I've been studying calculus by myself, and dude, MIT classes/problem sets/exams are TOO easy as you pointed out. I read on some forums people saying MIT is the hardest college in the U.S. and that some people spend 10+ hours on problem sets LMAO

MIT is a joke [2]

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I havent experienced any "interactive" math lessons on Brno University Of Technology either. And as you can see, it's not america. But in fact, I have a feeling that teacher has always just... too much to say that he/she hasn't want to be delayed ...

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
I think in the proof of the pumping lemma, p needs to be (at least) 1 + [the number of states in M]: only in that case is the input string guaranteed to repeat a state.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
thanks for this opportunity you have created for poor people :D

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
A link to the Matlab simulation prof Suvrit shows would be great

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
sounds drunk on 0.5 speed

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
just hope you remember the minus F on the test.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
so much fun, so much love. Thank you Professor Strang and MIT for inspiring more people around the world. I truly enjoy learning linear algebra with Professor Strang :) we know he's done it!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did it go?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I've never had a chance to learn determinants this way. It was always that teachers gave out a bunch of formulas and methods and made students memorize without further explanations. Thanks for walking us step by step through this wonderful concept, Prof. Strang.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
thank god someone uploaded a better audio/video quality version the other one was abysmal

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Helped me a great deal to get the method and tricks straight for transform math

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Conclude the lecture: The solution will exist only when rank(A)=rank(A|b), which would be x=x(particular)+x(nullspace), x(nullspace) exists only when rank(A)<n, where n stands for the number of columns.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]My multi variable prof is asian and its verry very hard to understand him

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
it feels great to be getting in on the ground floor of the singularity

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm in PreCal now, I've been at it for almost 2 full months. I have a 93 average, and it is definitely not as hard as I thought it would be.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Too bad not technical enough

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
I've learned more in this hour than in a four-months course

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I think statistics is branch of mathematics

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Respected sir,Lectures 8,17,26,34 lectures are missing..Were theory was taught in these lectures??

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
no proofs, this looks more like a recipe than real mathematics.

### Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!
20:48 ~~ That was cute grandpa sigh!!!

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
After proving line integral for gradients is end point - start point, weren't the consequences already obvious?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Please we want also a differential geometry and partial differential equations courses ❤🙏

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
In 26:51, the professor writes Gradient(f) = entries of X^-1. Do anyone know how to get that equation? Thanks!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how can i download  these vedios plzz any one help me

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Gauss invented the elimination method just because he born earlier :D The confidence !

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
"Gauss would quit; but Jordan says keep going" 😂😂

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Wow wow

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Hi:

I think in the example talks about electric Networks, so LOOP is correct. In fact OPEN LOOP and CLOSED LOOP is used frecuently in electric Networks or in Control Systems to study things that Stability,etc.
Cycle is used in the time domain to know the frecuency and in fact, the frecuency is measured in CYCLES/SEG or Hz.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
The cameraman here is now a Senior ML Engineer at Google, California.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
17:29 by the way a rangle is a bit of gravel fed to a hawk

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
did you hear someone in the class burp loudly about two minutes before the end? How gross!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thanks for the great lecture !

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I've got a question. Geometrically, vector coordinates calculated as vector's endpoint coordinates minus vector's beginning coordinates, which would make all parallel vectors of the same length and direction have same coordinates. When we talk about vector spaces and subspace in geometric sense, do we only mean thos who have (0,0) as their origin? I mean, that makes sense, since if we take into account literally all geometrical vectors, the whole notion of spaces wouldn't make sense, but that wasn't explicitly clarified, was it?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wonderful explanation. 
Taylor's formula evaluated at 0 is just Maclaurin's formula. 
The generalization would be to evaluate at each x=a, so one would replace the x^n term with (x-a)^n within the Taylor formula and evaluate the differentiations at a.

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
we really need doctors like him in our university cause most of our doctors cant even explain 10% of what he said.... most of the students taking the same course are failing because of our bad doctors

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
to be honest, the blackboard is better than my uni

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Beauty of mathematics lies in the proofs, the arguments made for proof rather than mugging the result and finding the answer :)

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Impressed ❤️

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Same, what was so funny!?!?

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Can someone explain to me when we should use Frobenius norm and when we should use the nuclear norm ?

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
For anyone watching this who doesn't feel like they are completely getting the concept, Prof Strang has an updated lecture in 18.065 on the SVD, which I think lays it out in a cleaner way: https://youtu.be/rYz83XPxiZo

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What an amazing teacher

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I hate math.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
When you combine those lectures with the ones from 3 Blue 1Brown you get a superb class that opens the doors to mastery. Tank you. I am teching myself math just for the fun of it thanks to You Tube!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I olny had math until 6th form  (around 12th grade) and i was invited one day to see a matrix class. 
And let me tell after the first 14 minutes of this video i really felt in love with maths

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I have a doubt in Difference equations part. He writes u_0 as a combination of eigen-vectors of A. Why should this be true?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think profs in my college shld go through these lectures before lecturing the students.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you for the lectures, they are very helpful.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
44:58 What is E times A? EA sports

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
This third quiz seems very fair in comparison to earlier quizzes. DR. Strang there is a heavy thought goes into answering questions  correctly on quiz 3. I understand quiz 3 really well in comparison to quiz1 and two. For an ivy league school like MIT, your students are very fast learners for  all technical classes.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
my prof. can come and learn from this prof.


### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Copyrighted in 2000, made in 2005...

Has MIT discovered time travel??

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
21:11 there is a subtitle error, he doesn't say anything about complex numbers. It could cause confusion for people who are deaf.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

This max and min method makes intuitive sense but does anyone have a proof showing that if the gradient is zero and the matrix is positive definite then the function is a local minimum?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very interesting video, thank you!
A very good teacher too, but when the time of demonstration comes the explanations are less understandables!

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
So I was a bit confused by his (a,b) notation but I think I got it. 
So in his 'practice' example we have mean = 1/2 (a,b). (a,b) is really the matrix [a b]. With probabilities 1/2 we pick either the matrix [a 0] or [0 b]. So we average the matrices to get 1/2 [a,b]. Now two samples means we get two matrices randomly with the above probabilities and add them. If X is a random variable, mean(2X) = 2 mean(X), so we multiply the mean by two to get [a b], the original matrix. 
Hope this helps someone.

### 23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
In the fisher scoring algorithm, why do we only take the expectation of the hessian and not also of the gradient. I mean, we want to minimize the KL divergence, i.e. the expectation of the negative log likelihood that we approximate by a second order taylor expansion. Then we should take the expectation of the whole approximation, right?

Yes! Smart = ability to apply intelligence (which includes learning), intelligent = Knowing something already; Your intelligence quotient (iq) measures your level of "smartness" not your intelligence. Therefore the op meant intelligent. And for some people it takes more than one or two exposures to a topic to fully learn it, but once they do, they can apply it well.

miyvarxar gilbert MIYVARXAR

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]Sorry, now i think i got what u were saying. i think u meant to write "I think P U L is a subspace﻿ only IF ( not 'in') line L lies in the plane." That makes completely sense. Thanks.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Funny accent

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Do not all speak at once...in vacant class😅😅

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Ć

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
41:41, their "Gauss given order"... that's a way to put it

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
54 dislikes, 2400 likes, there is a 54/2454 = 2.2% chance someone watching this will be unhappy

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
You're clearly too smart for one of the best science universities in the world if you know what the first lecture in a class is about. You could probably ace every subject at MIT without studying.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
camera...

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Very clearly explained!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
There are no students...!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
love seeing teachers look at notes

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Can someone, please, provide the link to full playlist for this course?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he really looks like a genious..amazing lecture..

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
maybe he just appreciated guys having fun with math xD

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I guess I'll just skip this cos sin stuff since I'm not really in physics. 

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I am not clear about Prof Strang's explanation at 37:22. He said we choose the eigenvector basis [0 1]^T and [1 0]^T, but this is the standard basis in R^2, right?

Does he mean that if the input and output basis are the eigenvector basis, then the transformation matrix A is just Λ?

Thanks.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I am econ Student and have studied Regression in my statistics class but never was able to understand how exactly was it connected to Nullspace and Column Space . Totally a new persepective  , Thanks a lot for this series Prof Strang and MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It is so beautiful when you finally understand and can figure out those  e matrices quickly and put it together into one transformation matrix.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How come at 45:55 when -2*(-y) it's -2 instead of +2

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
i guess there are no students because strang did this on sunday and said look my video for lecture 10 on monday :D

### 13. Regression
Normies in the comments can't understand MIT lectures, nothing incredible about this xD

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Could any one please tell me why the vector f towards outside of the circle? Isn't the rule of physic tells that the force is towards inside the circle? Thank you very much.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Is there a link to the notes Prof. Strang keeps alluding to?

39:40

😂😂😂

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Does he want students to shout out answers?  Because I'd be talking a lot.  I'd have to ask him, if he just meant us to think about it or to say it.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
OMG I failed algebra. Now I'm listening to MIT math.....

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I am finally learning the basics of linear algebra.

Thank you Mr.Jerison!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Why some people thumbed down on this? This is just priceless.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
It's an extraordinary and amazing one.. No other lecturer are as good as Gilbert... 
Thank you sir........

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
您是我见过的最好的老师，祝您身体健康   
You are the best teacher I have ever met. I wish you good health

Hyothesis testing is the weakest subfield in mathematics

### 13. Regression
skip from 26:00 to 35:00

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Full respect to Prof. Strang. So excited to see his insights to trendy technologies and he breaking down how it works.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Thank you, Professor Strang! I've learned a lot from your lectures! Stay healthy!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
sorry for much comments i am searching a chartable relationship to Japanese method of multiplication pardon, so excited

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]@[USERNAME]yeah im learning the basics of this in yr 9 in australia, and came here to learn more before i go into senior school

### 3. Parametric Inference
at time 1:12:36, the instructor stated the expectation to be P. What is P representing here? In the case of the statistical model, P represents the Family of Distributions......

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
32:39 when you run into your ex

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
interesting exciting

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Thanks,very clear

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It doesn't affect the teaching, but if affects the learning (especially of those who were late)

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Awesome video sir! Thank you!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT students haven't seen the law of cosines ... smh

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
12:56 paraboloid

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
What does it mean min(X,Y) and max(X,Y) in 22:00 ?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The question he actually meant/wanted to ask is the one he asked at 26:00 which is essentially the same as the one you pointed out and would equal your second interpretation. Because if all columns are INdependent the subspace would be 3D (in R4) but if the 3e column would be Dependent the subspace would be 2D (in R4) and the 3e column would just be a variation (linear combination) of the 1e and 2e columns. By the way, the only 4D subspace in R4 possible is R4 itself.

### 34. Final Course Review
Few people get here

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why were there so many dislikes?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A

I dont even know why I'm watching this ..

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
At which time do the blackboards become visible?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Dear Professor, Linear algebra is fascinating. I had difficulty understanding Algebra because I could not see beyond the symbols and notations. But I did not realize before that algebra is a symbolic language to express geometric shapes.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
10:25 Can somebody explain why did he say that S union U doesn't form a subspace??

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I live in Minnesota and when I try to watch these it tells me this video is not available in my country. Why is that?

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
After reading so many texts finally some actual geometric interpretation of L1 and L2 ...he explains it so beautifully.Came here only to understand definition but his charsima made me watch whole 50 mins

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish you were my actual teacher, but I guess this will do! Great vids, great teachers.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
lol this guy's accent is hilarious.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I actually consider Professor Gilbert Strang to be one of my heroes 🏆❤️🙏🏽🎊

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
i hated this class. I found it useless.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
This is what we learn in 4 classes of same length

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
"Me and the guys in the nullspace"

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Always interesting to hear how bad the questions are from the students. Really begs to question the standards they have for admissions.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
"today was all letters, numbers next time" 😌😌

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You repeat for the rest. Remember You now have not only the number that zeroes lets say A but also B that you can use! see the second part of the video to learn why!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, MIT OCW and Professor Strang.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Spivak's calculus might be to confusing for someone that's starting, but is an awesome book.

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
I think Indian teachers are far better than mit teachers. And we study this in our 12 grade.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
He explains it so clearly its amazing. Instead of just throwing around the definition of it all he actually explains and gives examples on why and how it works, in a simplified manner.

### 10. Computation History Method
This is amazing thank you for sharing this, I'm taking a computation course based on Michael Sipsers book, and having these lectures from the author himself is very nice change of pace sometimes if I feel like watching a lecture instead of reading the book. Both the book and the way Michael explains the material in these lectures are simply top notch. Again, thank you so much!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I m in love with  how humbly he finishes his lecture.His lecture will be Immortal.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In the case where x approaches 0 in the expression of (cosx-1)/x, one can find the value of the expression using geometric intuition.

When "angle x" approaches 0 then the arc length "x" becomes equal to sinx, just as Professor explained in the video. But (cosx-1)/x is another nut to crack.

Let there be a *single* triangle made by the radius of the unit circle and the x-axis with hypotenuse "H", adjacent side "A" and opposite side "P". Let the angle made by the radius to the x-axis be "x". Now let's take a look at (cosx-1)/x

We know from Professor's explanation that Arc length *"x"= sinx* (when x approaches 0), so put the value of x=sinx in (cosx-1)/x, and we can write (cosx-1)/x as:

*(cosx-1)/sinx*
Rearrange it as:

*(Cosx/sinx) - (1/sinx)*
Note that (Cosx/sinx)=A/P and (1/sinx)=H/P {basic definitions}

(cosx-1)/x=
(A/P)-(H/P)=(A-H)/P

Now take a look at Hypotenuse and the Adjacent side.
As angle x gets smaller and smaller, Hypotenuse moves towards the adjacent and when x becomes infinitesimally small, *Hypotenuse "H" will nearly become equal to Adjacent "A"* ( or you can say that "H" will nearly superimpose on "A")

Therefore *H=A* for a very small angle x.
So :
(cosx-1)/x       =(A-A)/P=0

P.S》I thought about sharing this because there were a lot comments regarding this problem. I'm not trying to act like a nerd or genius, as I have been learning calculus for only some time and and it is pretty obvious that my skill is infinitesimally weak with respect to that of the Professors of MIT. This is what I've leart from his geometrical approach.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I actually just took a formal linear algebra class at my university and it's crazy how the lectures are so similar. So I feel at least I'm getting a good education from my uni for a good price.

### 24. Classical Inference II
this guy so cool

### 2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem
omg... this cameraman...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder how many people in this class have actually taken calculus before. Something tells me that the level of the presentation is not intended for an introductory level. Feels more like a master class

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This class was so good and his explainations are so lucid.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
looking like Jimmy Dore on the thumbnail

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is his first lecture that I watch about a topic that I didn't previously know. Now I can finally see how brilliant he is at explaining because I have never heard any of this stuff before and it still makes sense the first time I hear it. My brain almost exploded at the complex and yet simple beauty of what he's explaining. It's almost like he's doing a magic trick because we know all the laws of math and he can just take them and make something possible that I never would have thought possible.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
So nine columns is a plane with vectors that normalize the matrix to be a sort of 8th dimensional plan e in a 9 dimensional space that would be simple to resolve with every right hand side manipulation and will not be at all difficult to understand as shown here.  Let me create a matrix and a fabricated vector and think of it as one of these and two of those and get a component of a 1 and a 6 or 7 plus a 12 and a 3 - but that's not the right way to do it.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ Brian Ebers: As he said, can be used to solve problems in physics. More generally, multivariable calculus is a stepping stone to more advanced topics like differential forms and tensor calculus.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you so much for releasing this course :).

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
A este hombre ,le deseo mil vidas mas a su vida ,es una gran persona con un amor a expandir el conocimiento  hacia todo rincón del planeta ,Que con decir millones de gracias no es suficiente .Gracias por existir,gracias por tu contribución desinteresada a ayudar al projimo ,Dios  te bendiga grandemente

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great job. What's more, Professor Miller's voice is like Steve Jobs'. It's beautiful.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get it, why does he subtract 2? 18:05

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thabk you subtitles T_T

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
sorry i got lost at 32"14 what exactly happened with how he got the last row of that matrix which was almost an identity ?


### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is a good teacher, but he leaves some points out, in which case you really have to just sit down, pause the video, and go through the steps he's doing very carefully. Especially for the geometric proof. But it's very understandable.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
27:00
To find the combination you're going to scale the first one by a and the second one by b, then try to find c:
From first column: 2a+3b=5
From second column: a+b=7
Working on first:
2(7-b)+3b=5
b=5-14=-9
Working on second:
a=7-(-9)=16
So:
16.r1 - 9.r2 = r3

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lots of love

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
First Solved Example: 20:42

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
What fascinates me are some stats you can find below this video. Maybe it's some bug but youtube tells us that this video is most popular among:
1) men 45-54 yo
2) men 35-44
3) men 25-34
Which I find really strange cause I've thought that most of viewers would be actual students.
Also, popularity by region is interesting stat.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Please record mathematical statistics 18.655, thanks!

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
This is maybe the best lecture in the entire course.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Frobenius norm squared = trace of (A transpose times A) = sum of eigenvalues of (A transpose times A) = sum of squares of singular values

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thanks for you great lecture!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Even though, It was not complicated at all, I  felt so overwhelmed.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thats easy lol

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
La matriz adjunta debiera de estar transpuesta en la fórmula. minuto 44:40 and beyond.                     adj()^T.                                                                          El profesor lo infiere en el cálculo (por cierto, gracias por su trabajo)

can anyone help me how  he got  values 0 and 1 during  derivation of cosine and sine

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Where's the pdf for the exam that he is going through in this video?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
after 10 years, I still cannot clearly understand why the dimension of the null space is n-r...

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Why do physicists avoid using/thinking in terms of basis? why are they unwilling to bring them in?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really want to thank MIT OCW fore the opportunity to really learn calculus, and even better, from one of the best places in the world. We don't have this kind of teatching here in Brazil, not anywhere near this. I'm very thankful for you opening this class to everyone.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]umm KwH is energy.  If it wasn't multiplied by hours, then ya it would be per unit time.  Also he lives in the U.S.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why are lectures 8,17,26,34 missing from the playlist?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
so many chalkboards!!!


### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
holy shit....18.06 for life

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
How are the students getting picked up on the microphone? I think that it is neat as it is usually difficult to hear the students’ questions.

### 12. Iterated Expectations
love it


### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So much better than watching Netflix...Thanks a million both teachers are awesome!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
This lecture is what MIT means in this world!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sometimes Maths feels like a religion. Have faith on me till I prove it. At least he proves it.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Amazing lectures

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Cutest teacher! EE starts counting from 0, we start counting from 1. Actually they probably right.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

And they study in college
Indian education is higher than America

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I cant get the link of the complete course :/

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
1A-5 What are the ij-components of a plane vector A of length 3, if it makes an angle of 30 degrees with i and 60 degrees with j. Is the second condition redundant?

If Denis Auroux was my math teacher all my life Euler would be eating my dust.

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
19:40 "Mewtwo is below lambda one" I've never heard of that Pokemon, is it new?

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'd advise you to read Dr. Strang's chapter on Integration before you attempt to make sense of this lecture.  The lecture moves quickly and instructor assumes the students understand integration

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the textbook for this course?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I'm not sure what you're talking about. If you look at any of the other lectures in this series you can see people in seats while he is talking. & at the end of some of the lectures you can see students getting up from their seats. That doesn't happen in this video. Also, in this video, he makes some comment like "Don't all speak at once" which seems to be a reference to the fact that there is no one there. What does the fact that you can't see them have to do with how good they are as students?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Toller Vortrag! Vielen Dank Professor!

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
excellent lecturer, but terrible cameraman!.. The cameraman, has no mathematical background of whatsoever, and it is frustrating how s/he either to slow or to fast to zoom in and out of the pictures, during the respective lecture!..

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why did he take the example of China rather than French 😂

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
very sad way to explain polynomial decomposition, I'de rather go with the french way "members identification", its way easier and faster

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
On 21 minute I don't understand where these matrices come from and why we need them. Anyone care to elaborate?

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Great course! I really enjoy it :-) Especially the lectures about cyclic and toeplitz matrices are very interesting. Mostly because I came across toeplitz before and wondered that Lapack doesnt seem to have any special routines for block toeplitz and alike.( if I now remember correctly what I was searching for...) 
Seems like there are some structures behind these matrices such that calulations reduce quite signigicantly ... even for block-Toeplitz? And therefore only quite a few codes out there for block toeplitz?   Talking about big to very big Ax=b systems (1 Mio unknowns on a normal laptop computer), inverse of Hessian matrices, fairly sparse, nearest neighbour interactions

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Best Explanation

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is the most usless think i have ever seen in my life...here let me tell you what the answer is . WHO! the EFF! cares, over, what a waist of time, to the, LAME!!! to the 25th power of i feel sorry for whoever finds this interesting.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Best Class I have ever seen...Wish I could be one of the students sitting in the classroom.

### Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory
Automated motion-tracking is a solution searching a problem. :/

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
16:56 IT'S CORONA TIME *_*

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13r9QY6cmjc#t=29m29s how does one know that u0 can be expressed in terms of eigenvectors, i.e. how do we know what u0 is in the span of eigenvectors?

### 34. Final Course Review
It has been an honour, Prof Strang

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Please @mitopencourseware. Please label each video with the content covered in the video! I'm begging you!

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is it that (N + 1) Cn + 1 / N +1  simplifies to Cn + 1 / (N+1) rather than just simplifying to just Cn + 1 ?

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
why is a numerical low rank matrix hard to invert? he mentioned it briefly when introducing the vandermonde matrix but didn't clarify later.

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
I don't understand why E[X|X>1]=1+E[X] if the first try fails? if the first try fails then how come there is +1 because +1 means that you obtain the HEAD at the first try? And if so how can we add 1 to that?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Congratulations to all who made it, 🎉🎉🎉




and thanks to mit ocw for providing such high quality content

at 5:56 he says that x1,....,xn are gaussian? what is each Xi denoting in this case?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
thanks again!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, Prof. Gilbert and MIT OCW for the lectures.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
People strolling in late to one of the greatest linear algebra lectures ever given.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you Dr. Gilbert, you made me fall in love with math,I hope everything is well.❤️🍀

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
It's really crazy that rational, integer and natural sets are all the same cardinality

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That's precisely my point. I'm putting in doubt how true it the 'world class' character or MIT, supousedly an institution reserved to high profile minds. If this is what you have for the first year, and if how you say, alumni have to learn 'by writing things down', thanks but I'm staying here in my free-of-charge public university, and I'll head to Lomonosov Univ. of Moscow for my post-grads! And I was more specific... not about writing things down or not, but about The Exposition...

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Love you sir

### Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators
Are you teaching to an empty classroom for this class? Your "I'm going to assume you're laughing" comment led me to believe you were! Which is very impressive.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
i HAVE FAST TODAY. I really dont want to do any thing but i started your lecture and just get busy in dimensions. kudos to you Sir. you are my mood changer.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
this woman seems really in love judging from the way she looks at him and talks to him haha :D

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
42:00 use SVD, the smallest SVD and square SVD

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent episodes i watched them all, i learned a lot thank you MIT, thank you  Prof Auroux, sorry bye for now 18.02 :( , hey wait for me 18.03 i'm coming :D .. HAHA!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks alot

### 34. Final Course Review
OMG! Like everyone else here the whole lecture series has been mindblowing! I have been obsessed with it for the past week putting around 5 hours per day just absorbing the material, it is magnificent! I always had problems with Linear Algebra and I have a Computer Vision Exam in two weeks that depend a lot on linear algebra. I tried somehow to get around it like I did with other courses but I then decided that enough is enough and I need to understand what Linear Algebra really is about. Never expected it to be that elegant and that simple! This is ART!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
not all.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
What a beautyfull person

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
East or West, Prof Strang is the best!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:51 geometric interpretation of differentiation
12:00 steps in computing slopes
21:50 check for the plausibility of computed slopes
25:30 the hardness in solving a problem involving calculus
33:50 use symmetry as a shortcut
37:00 the hardest part of calculus, the resolving of variable names

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Quality teaching!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I HOPE THAT I COULD GIVE 2 THUMB UP!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
You are doing so many people a favor by posting this. Seriously.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:16 I think there is a mistake here. That is not Newton's notation (which is usually noted with a dot on the top). The "f prime" notation like the professor wrote it should be Lagrange notation.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Hello sir I have a doubt in math 
Can you please help me

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best chalk I have ever seen

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I'm proud to live on one planet with this honorable man. Both his lectures and his textbook are wonderful. The only textbook which was actually fun to read. And it was quite deep into the subject. Thank you, Professor.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Quite interesting.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks so much, Professor Strang!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well this is an awfully unknowledgeable math class. How does one get to multivariable calculus without a firm knowledge of trigonometry and vector geometry?

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Are graphs build in Mapple? Recognized the commands, that were used

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
The first 5 minutes is like professor speaking alien language to me :'(

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
What is written on the board is not clear

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
a great prof..   abstract maths can so easily taught .... Its amazing...... Great ..... hats off to u 
U should come up with simillar lect in analysis

### 34. Final Course Review
Who else watched in 1.5x or 1.75x ?

Thanks, Prof. Strang.
Thanks, MIT OCW.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Dear guys : any books recommended for accompanying this excellent course ? Thanks

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks a lot for posting all this, it's really appreciated!

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Am getting an SVD tattoo.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Column space is span of  pivot columns and dim(Colspace) (rank)= number of pivot cols
BUT !
Even tough dim(nullspace) = number of free variables, nullspace is not span of free variable columns. Have I just get it right? 

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture, but i am confused by positive theta opening in clockwise direction.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
If this is linear algebra.  I don't know what rubbish they are teaching in schools and colleges.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
mathematics well thought

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
One of the best teachers I've had pleasure to learn from - only online, but thanks to quality of content and ease of acces it feels almost as good.
THANK YOU MIT!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
This Professor is simply amazing. So humble to teach and so thorough. Thanks for this!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thank you Prof. Strang for these

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was skeptical seeing all the comments how he'd be. Considering how hard it is so jump en media res into a set of lectures and be clear, he does ok... But the moment he takes out the chain and they applaud him is one I'll never forget till I die. And that's why he gets the gold star. He may not have had the best technique in this one day, but I'll forever have that memory tethered into this topic.

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Also at about 21:00 there is a good question from a student. He is confused on the variables x=x'(t) and y=y'(t), in some calculus books they try to avoid the confusion and represent it as x=f'(t) and y=g'(t).

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
basis of R^n spans the space of R^n, but at 43:46, the column space is R^3 and we had only 2 linearly independent vectors so how can it create a basis? because with only 2 vectors we cant span R^3.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Liars figure & figures lie. Not quite what he said in the intro but pretty close--close enough in fact.

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
I should have begun this course earlier instead of turning it down because of the recording quality.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
I'd say without any doubt that Professor Strang is the best Algebra professor in the entire world. I'm sure he has helped tons of students all around the world to understand the beauty of algebra

### 12. Iterated Expectations
JT  is an excellent lecturer! Easy to follow his explanations on stochastic processes!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
its not even fair how much better this guy is than my prof

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Mr Strang and MIT ,thank you so much.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Math Rules :)

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Way of solving ❤️

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Man, it's crazy. I watch these MIT lectures on biochemistry or computer science, and they make me feel dumb. Then, I come to math/stats/machine learning (my areas of study) and suddenly they seem palatable and even easy at times. Knowledge can be so deep and so specialized that there is just no way any one person can have enough time to learn all of these topics!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I used this course for passing my Exam P from SOA. Great great course! Cannot recommend it enough. Prof. Tsitsiklis has an amazing ability to make abstract concepts super intuitive. e.g. Never had to remember any formulae for discrete space conditional probability. Transforming into the sub-universe was enough to compute all probabilities. All the TAs are great as well. 

Big Thank you to Prof. Tsitsiklis and everyone involved and of course MIT OCW for making this available to everyone! I am heading straight to the donations page :-)

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
50:45    [-1 0]
can be the vector space?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I Really Like The Video The Four Fundamental Subspaces From Your

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
who else sees double and triple integrals as nested for loops...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Can anyone help me understand, why the professor keep saying at 19:01 that we can't solve 4 equation with 3 unknowns?

Simple rule is if you have as many equation as unknowns then it's easy to solve but above statement has one extra equation so easy to solve.

Right?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sorry had a typo! o.o

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Linear Algebra useless? Silly boy, the very computer you're writing this comment on wouldn't exist without it... heck, nothing in the modern world works without the linear algebra being utilised in the background. Learn something before you share your lack of knowledge.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Beautiful lecture. Thanks

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good Job Professor

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Adamın dibi

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm a freshman in college and I'm only taking BASIC ALGEBRA

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Good point, I had forgotten about that.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
This must be the best lecture I have ever had.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Cool video


### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I don' even know why I go to my linear algebra lectures anymore. This guy is amazing.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
listening to professor Strang is like watching a sci-fi movie, time to time i start seeing the exact same concept in different view points.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
If all youtube content would be deleted today, the most upsetting thing for me would probably be losing this series of lessons.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
He has clearly deep understanding  about what is he saying...excellent lecture!!🇧🇩🇧🇩

### 15. NP-Completeness
Really well explained! Thank you!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
these statistics do not suit for psychology

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
What are 8 rule for vector space.. which he never wrote. Any answer ???

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
oooow , he speak like the banana in rick and morty ! that satisfact me

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
no french

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Excellent teacher. The little touches like reinforcing important concepts as he's moving on to new ones that make use of them is very helpful.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The course is so slow, and isn't this high school math, which we all had already taught in high school?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this was recorded in 1999.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
If I need to understand this lecture to proceed with the rest of the course, I’d better just give up maths for life...

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I remember my college years when sometimes I really needed to go back in time and check what the teacher just said, when the material was hard for me to understand, or I needed to draw a better conclusion. It's great that we have videos nowadays.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
A lecture on the unit disk would be appreciated!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Sorry to say how small your brain is TBArKER, you check the MIT lectures only to check how many blacks are in there? That is incredibly unreal.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
through single matrix transformation, the whole subspace will expand or shrink with the rate of eigenvalues in the direction of its eigenvectors, suppose you can decompose a vector in this subspace into the linear combination of its eigenvectors, so after many times of the same transformation, the random vector will ultimately land on one of its eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Thank you for uploading these. It's always great to be able to watch education for free :)
I have a question about the course tho: I'm still very irritated that there hasn't been a single proof so far. Could someone please explain to me how the courses there work?
Like, is only half of the course uploaded? Or are the proofs in the books and they omit them in the lecture?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I have seen many online lectures from Mister Strang when he was younger, and it saddens me to see him this old, yet still remarkably shrew. 
I hope he stays with us for a few more years until i can go to the USA and see him live.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...

King Gilbert Strang 🙏

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Teaching in empty class and still remaining cool. Great professor!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Can anyone tell me why is it a must for (A^T)(A) to have an inverse? o.O

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
"Einstein can do it." I love it when he said that :)

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Would be nice to update the requirements of this course in https://ocw.mit.edu/18-217F19 because you start using concepts that you don't define (concepts that are easy to find the definition, but the course page says you don't require previews knowledge) this isn't true. With the simple concepts as colouring and stuff like that. Maybe a link to a Discrete Maths course would be good for the people that want to see this course and doesn't have the basic. This type of approach may discourage people of studying Maths because they would think they can follow and is because they don't know simple concepts that can be referenced or at least commented.
In any case, thanks for the free course.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
2,3,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,25 - these are topics needed for economics&finance majors

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Thanks a lot !

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Thanks!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Usually it is a bit noisy in the beginning... I guess it is because the students open the door or something... But in this lec seems like the door was opened in the middle of the lecture... Late to the class maybe O.o...  :P 

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Audio channels fixed!

The pdf there has a great derivation of it using the dot product & the idea of a normal vector ;)


### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
well i got impressed at the begining, but when he stated the second eigenvalue i realized it is just the golden ratio... That does not demerits him, he's great!

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
In LU decomposition he assumed that l1*u1 will cancel first column of A. And he took u1 as the first row of A. But what if the first row of A have first element as zero.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I got 0 0 -5 too. I don't know if we're right though?


### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’d solve the cone problem like this:
The radius=r of a cone increases linearly at height=h, so if r goes from 0 at the h=0, to 4 at the h=10, then r=2 at the h=5.
The surface area of water is just a circle, so at h=5, it is 2pi*2 = 4pi.
The instantaneous speed of the height increase is the same as that of a cylinder with base area equal to the surface area of water at that height, so it’s just volume/time divided by area or 2/4pi = 1/2pi.

Or in other words: just calculate the surface area of water at appropriate height and divide the added volume speed by it.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
If the gradient is a vector, why isn't there any arrow on top of it?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Such amazing lecture ... this may be helpful too    https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU?list=PL2QY0xcsWhz6ghPUixeNQm47xapSKw4SM

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank You very prof. strang for this lectures. I always thought if prof. strang would have taught this lectures then it would be the best. Now we have this. Now I will get up early and my first task will be to complete prof. strang lectures. Thank You very much professor. Be healthy and long live.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I had this guy for Calculus I and II. I can't believe how much of a difference something like having nice and clear handwriting makes!

### 4. Counting
Bizim okullarda anlatılan derslere bak bide bunlara bak, sonra ülkeler arasındaki farklara bak; sebebi belli oluyor.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
anas hatem: If you think of the integral as the area below a curve, and you're splitting that area into infinitely narrow rectangles, then the height of such a rectangle is the value of the function f, while the width of that rectangle is dx. Taking the integral means you're summing up the area of all of those rectangles with area f(x) dx.﻿

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
why is there no explanation on what the pivots are and why you need them? It doesn't make sense to me why you only need to make the bottom left 0's when doing elimination

nvm i see that its because you need to eliminate one variable in one equation, two in the next, and then plug in the values for the third

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
20:32 I FuXX

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
There should be a way to directly thank this professor after the lecture. So lucid and clear. Hats off Sir.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In the function
     w=a.x^2 + b.xy + c.y^2
x and y play the same role, there is a form of symmetry.
That means the sign of c would matter the same as the sign of a, right?
But how he ends up discussing only the sign of, and not that of c?!!

Anyone?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’m taking calc AB right now as a senior in high school and so far I know all this stuff but I plan on watching all the vids until I can understand it through these and then go over it again in class to make me double prepared this year, thank you so much MIT for this opportunity.

### 16. Markov Chains I
He is teaching probability through telling a story instead of saying again the formulas and definitions - what most teachers do.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Kids saw first time cycloid, and JEE students in INDIA remembering after solving ROTATION questions :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This seems like a good introductory course and I'm finding it helpful to review and refresh my previous knowledge. There is also a wonderful series of lectures from MIT done in 1970 by the amazing Herb Gross, called "Calculus Revisited." Herb is still alive and doing new videos on K-12 math. If you comment on his calculus videos, he might well reply. He is truly a unique and marvelous lecturer, and I highly recommend that series. You can find it on YouTube or on the same site this lecture series is on.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
horrible. Don't max out your volume. There's nothing till you get a huge surprise at 1:15. 
One of the cameras is tracking the movement of the lecturer, and it makes me dizzy. The view of the blackboard is enough. Even in 2016, the camera man at OCW still can't master how to record good video lectures.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
why is the third pivot number 5???

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much, professor, for making these lectures free. I simply want to learn the logic and these videos seriously help. I realize that people have criticized the fact that we haven't quite gotten to some of the more difficult stuff yet. But I understand the value of a solid foundation.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Sadly I haven't watched all of his videos yet but does anybody pay attention to the fact that he almost never used fancy terminologies?  At least those terms like:  vectors being closed under addition, vectors being closed under scalar multiplications... are not being used at all this lecture and many other later lectures.  In 100 math professors, maybe 1 or 2 does thing like what this professor does.  I see this is how he made himself a highly respected professor.  That is simply  because he cares for and focuses on the understanding of the materials he is delivering rather than focusing nearly half a class time to explain what those terms are.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The permutation matrix is the matrix needed to exchange rows. Such matrix must be the transpose of the identity matrix and it should be right multiplied by the input matrix. To do column exchange, we left multiply by the input matrix.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
35:21 how does he come up with that solution? Sounds so random

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
In the computation of the Eigen values for A², he used A = SʌSˉ¹ to derive that ʌ² represents its Eigen value matrix. However this can be true only if S is invertible for A², which need not be always true.

For example, for the matrix below (say A), the Eigen values are 1, -1(refer previous lecture). This would imply that A² has only one Eigen value of 1. This would imply that S has 2 columns which are same (if it has only one column then it is no longer square and hence inverse doesn't apply) and hence non invertible. This implies that this proof cannot be used for all the cases of the matrix A.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
could someone help me in this part 47:40, why it cannot be expressed and what does that mean?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Computational Linear Algebra course

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Professor Strang's introduction to projections using Fourier Series as an example generalizes to other orthogonal functions (Legrendre Polynimials, Bessel Functions, etc.).
This is pretty cool, because you'll see this stuff ad nauseum in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof. Auroux, Thank you for these wonderful lectures

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
hahahhahahahahaha I checked the comments after I watching the video of right ear.... poor me..

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He ties up all the loose ends in this lecture and in lecture 6, except that I don't know where lim k->infinity (1 + 1/k)^k comes from

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
I am a computer science undergrad watching these lectures because I felt I needed to understand Linear Algebra better for two fields: Machine Learning and Quantum Information. It's incredible that both of these get some overlap with this linear algebra course (ML was touched on when we did projection matrices as that is exactly the closed form solution to linear regression), and now QI which uses Complex vectors spaces is being covered. 

:)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Since you claim you are so good in math, I suggest you go work on your English. It sounds garbled and fuzzy. 

After that, why won't you try to find your humility. I could probably guarantee you aren't as smart as you claim yourself to be/

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I am so glad that he is still blessing this world with his presence! I have hated maths all life until I encountered 18.06 last year!

This series is Breaking Bad level high. Same highs and lows and tension and mystery and excitement

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The beauty of calculus is that the machinery itself is not complicated, there are limited tools, but the scope and application has been as wide as humanity's imagination.
You just have to develop the intuition and everything is easy then, good lectures by OCW, as always

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
This lecture is especially beautiful..

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh I voted for the fourth answer the plane as well, but I thought it was because 2 vectors(<1,2,3> and <x,y,z>) form two lines so they could define a plane which contains both of them, I was so wrong haha.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Thank you Prof Gilbert and thank you MIT OCW.

P.S: I just noticed that the comment section is dominated by men.... Come on girls, we can do it.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I took this class at community college. Aced it

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I am very grateful to this teacher, this teacher's lecture has given me a strong interest in linear algebra. (In counting the number of viewers in this class, there are actually many Chinese viewers who watch it in other ways - like me, we all like your teaching style and think you are a good teacher!)😁😁😁

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Timestamps and Summary of Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory 

0:00 - Motivation and Introduction 
Functional analysis works with vector spaces that are sometimes infinite-dimensional, using the techniques of analysis to study their structure & functions defined on them. Besides existing as a pure mathematical discipline, it finds applications in partial differential equations and physics. 

5:27 - Review of Vector Spaces
Vector spaces are defined over a field (here, R or C) and are closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Every vector space has a basis, or a maximal spanning set; its dimension is the cardinality of any basis (this is well-defined). e.g. Finite-dimensional vector spaces over R: R^n (n-fold Cartesian product)

13:46 - An Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space
The set of continuous functions from [0, 1] to the complex numbers forms a vector space (sum, multiple of any elements are still in the VS). But the countably infinite set {1, x, x^2,...} is linearly independent in C([0, 1]). 

16:26 - Norms 
To perform analysis, we require a concrete notion of "proximity" or "size" on our spaces. A norm assigns to each vector in a vector space some nonnegative real number; as a map it is positive semidefinite, homogeneous, and satisfies the triangle inequality. 
A seminorm is similar to (but weaker than) a norm; it satisfies the latter two conditions but is not necessarily definite. A vector space endowed with a norm is a normed vector space: these are central objects of study in functional analysis.

21:15 - Metric Spaces
A metric on a set provides a notion of distance between its points. It is an identity-indiscernible, symmetric, and triangle inequality-satisfying function; a space with such a distance function is called a metric space (has the metric topology) 

23:08 - Norms Induce Metrics
Given a norm on a vector space, it induces a metric in the natural way. This allows us to talk about ideas like convergence, completeness, etc. with regards to normed vector spaces. 

26:11 - Examples of Norms (and NVS) 
Euclidean norm on R^n, C^n provide us with the most familiar notion of distance. We can consider more broadly the family of norms called p-norms, of which the Euclidean norm is a special case (taking p = 2). When p = ∞ we consider the norm that picks out the maximal component of a vector in n-space. 

32:45 - The Space C_∞{X}
From a metric space X we consider the space C_∞{X} of all continuous, bounded functions from X to the complex numbers. This indeed forms a vector space - on it, we can introduce the supremum norm that measures the maximal value a function takes. This turns C_∞(X) into a normed vector space. If we take X to be some compact interval like [0, 1], the boundedness of continuous functions are automatic.

39:24 - The Supremum Norm and Uniform Convergence
When asking what convergence in this metric means for functions in C_∞(X), we find it translates to uniform convergence in the familiar sense from real analysis. 

42:20 - l^p-Spaces
The l^p spaces consist of p-summable sequences. When p = 2, these are square-summable, etc. and these are all defined to be the sequences on which the respective p-norms resolve finitely. 

46:38 - Banach Spaces
We are interested in special cases of normed vector spaces that mimic the situation/structure in Euclidean spaces, namely, their completeness. We have seen that norms (on vector spaces) give rise to metrics, with respect to which we make sense of convergence of sequences. Cauchy sequences are those whose terms tend arbitrarily close; every convergent sequence is Cauchy, but the converse doesn't necessarily hold (the rationals have many "holes": one can construct a sequence of rationals that close in on sqrt(2) but can't converge to it in Q). Spaces for which the converse does hold, i.e. Cauchy sequences converge, are complete with respect to that given metric. Banach spaces are normed vector spaces that are complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm. 

49:52 - Examples of Banach Spaces
R^n, C^n are Banach spaces with respect to any of the aforementioned p-norms. These provide relatively trivial examples, but foundational ones. 

50:39 - C_∞(X) is Banach 
A useful nontrivial example - the normed vector space of continuous, bounded functions X -> C actually forms a Banach space with respect to the supremum metric. The process of showing that it is a Banach space amounts to exhibiting completeness, and is instructive in demonstrating the general procedure for showing that a space is Banach: first take a Cauchy sequence & come up with a candidate for its limit, then show that this proposed limit lies in the space, and finally show that the convergence does occur.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
how could he define the last 2 A's columns? 15:10

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is great.  I studied engineering at a university less prestigious than MIT, and I remember professors refusing to explain their algebra steps.  They were like "you should know this already".

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
basically, I got lost after 1:30 xD

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
"No mathematics went on there; we just got some vectors that were lying down to stand up."

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you're struggling to understand the Product Rule proof (he skips alot of steps) check out this video by Eddie Woo.  Much more clear :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkm-V59j8Zw

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a lol this stuff is studied in India in high school (even harder than this)

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
13:00 subspace S is orthogonal to subspace T means: every vector in S is orthogonal to vectors in T.

Can anyone explain what is going on there?

Nice video thanks will use information to finish my book

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Words would not suffice the knowledge that you have given us Dr. Strang
Thank you very much for these lectures.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
As a non English native speaker university student, the first minute of the video is like the professor speaking alien language to me :|

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
27:07 minimizing something with a constraint Lagrangian Formulation.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
"The simmetrical is the king of the matrices and the Orthonormal the Queen"... and the Queen and her twin sister get together with their greek lover(*beat starts at background*) listening Isaac Hayes and... wait! what we're talking again?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I never get sick of them; they're really cool to me.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I suggest anyone viewing this now goes and watches 3blue1brown's video on Duality... dot products / projections all make sense now in how they are encoded within each other... will help you understand what x = aTb / aTa actually means the ratio of the projection of b onto a : the length of a... but this is one hell of a lecture!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
At 36:22, it is fascinating how he got a bit into the orbital mechanics, saying there are 6 unknowns (which is rightly known at the State vector, which is a 6 by 1 matrix with Position (x,y,z) and velocities (xdot, ydot, zdot)).

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where can I find lectures that are missing?

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, professor Strang and all guys insist on this perfect linear algebra lecture.
I started this lecture on 23/12/2021 and completed it on 08/01/2022 in Hong Kong, just before my new semester. I will remember this 18.06 forever, and professor Strang will be the best linear algebra teacher in my heart!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I am so fascinated by the way that professor G. Strang  gives his lectures, he does it in such a  great way that even a 5 years old boy could understand , on the side , teachers from my university make the subject so complicated, that even highly above the avarege students struggle to understand the concepts poperly.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Georgia Tech > MIT

Our lectures and Calc 3 class is way harder...

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Not a single dislike. This video bring my faith to humanity back.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I Really Like The Video From Your Elimination with Matrices

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this for real undergradutes or is it an introductional course?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
(3, 3, 8) = -(1, 1, 2) + 2 * (2, 2, 5).
These three vectors are not linearly independent.  

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I have to disagree with people on this....I think the lecture starts off good but then he speeds onto areas without clear explanation.....I was thinking that if there are any new students in his room to stats then they may struggle ....but then again it is MIT so I guess all the students in there are pretty much top of their class

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]no. High School Calculus is nothing compared to a good freshman engineering calculus class. I assure you of this.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
who are the 3 ignorant folks?

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone tell me the meaning of 18.01,18.02 etc....

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That was pretty good.

"Extra shipping charges apply to boxes with negative dimensions."

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Wow, 15 years ago.. Prof. Strang looks like a kid!

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Isnt grad(f) supposed to be [x by] instead of [2x 2by]?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Is this a good course for data analytics

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Hi guys - I wrote an article on Inverse Matrices which was influenced by this lecture http://www.orrymr.com/post/inverse-matrix/ 
Writing it helped me understand a little better. Hopefully reading it can also be helpful.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Like watching someone like Aristotle teach

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
some of their behavior is really childish

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Why I hate math!  Where else is there guess work in math. 2+2=4 No guessing. Just do the procedure until the answer is revealed. But here, as you see in the video, we guess. We substitute, we try this and that. Pain in the butt!!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
41:21 it would help if it were in shot

I think this video further proves my point of view.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Compelling lecture (as always), but I'm unsettled about one thing: much of it is based on the fact that the first singular vector of A is the maximizing x in the definition of ||A||2. However, this fact just seems to be mentioned without proof or argument, and accordingly it doesn't feel as though the proof that ||A||2 = sigma1 is complete. Thoughts?

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions

Can you please explain your question?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thank you so much, great teacher, I had to retake Probability subject 2 times, and never quite grasped it, teacher only followed what was written in the book, there were no added insights, with this single lecture I got it so much better.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I actually liked the fact that he did an informal proof. Much better than doing the formal proof, cos that requires invoking Rolle's Theorem etc, which they don't cover in this course, presumably. 

Obviously, this course isn't meant to be extremely difficult. It's sort of a survey course, where the difficulty of the material is not so much. In that way, people who don't want to major in that subject don't have to face a difficult time if they want to learn something new.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
i'm sad for my left ear because it couldn't enjoy this fantastic lecture!!!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Integrate from 0 to (1/2) x^3 arctan(x) dx to 4 decimal places.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Somehow after some thought I figured out why Prof says all upper triangular matrices are subspaces of 3X3 Matrices! If we add any 2 upper triangular matrices we are still in that space as also if we multiply with scalar any upper triangular matrices we are still in that space. Same with Symmetric and Diagonal matrices. But Prof assumes that all students will decipher this and he did not spell that out. Otherwise its a privilege to hear from a genius!

can I do this way ? : sinx.cosdx + sindx.cosx - sinx / dx  dx→0 =
sinx.cos0 +sindx.cox - sinx /dx dx→0 =
using aproximation that sinx = x = tgx when x is too small, we have:
sinx - sinx + dx.cosx /dx dx→0 =
0/0 + dx.cosx /dx dx→0 = 
cosx dx→0 = cosx !

can I ?

DR. Strang thank you for counting and verifying the Parameters in SVD, LU, QR and Saddle Points in numerical linear algebra.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice, we covered a lot of multivariable calculus this year (a first for junior students in Hawaii) it was awesome, but since we also took AP Calculus BC during this year, it was a bit difficult to switch back for the exam and I ended up trying to use MV calc on the BC exam lol.  Smart idea to spend time reviewing the course materials ^^

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I’m trying to relax listening to this in bed but the chalk slamming is so aggressive in my headphones XD

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I wish I had instructors like him!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
45:50
Why does he add the constant c1?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
oh, these classes are so awesome, I wanted to clap at the end of the video.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Hats Off Professor, You are an inspiration!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Really nice way to break down formalism into geometrical interpretation. The linear algebra script of my university (germany) is extremly formal/theoretical (theorem + proof, theorem + proof,... etc), took me a while to build up geometrical interpretations on my own but I had some gaps, filled by Gilbert Strang and other sources (from books/web), => I say thank you ;)

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
here you go: /watch?v=eHJuAByQf5A

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Nice prof. Wish I had this guy when I was struggling in my own Stats class years ago.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
why did he make the columns space equal to m rather than n i didnt't understand isn't supposed to column space is equal or less than the number of columns  in the matrix. he wrote the column space to be the number of rows dimension 38:04

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
this is the easy way to introduce linear algebra, and all profs should do it like that. not with groups, homomorphisms and vector spaces...

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
hope to see one planimeter someday, which seems cool. 

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
11:02

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]True but the rest of us don't understand you. It's ok though, artists aren't understood either  ;D

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
He's talking about multiplying a matrix by a vector, which is O(n^2).

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Im a beginner in Linear Algebra, what books can you recommend for me to read?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Dual Picture -> Mind = Blown

### 34. Final Course Review
I can't believe I am here
First time I feel passion about learning during my colleage time
I believe people who ever listen to your course will appreciate deeply
Thank you! really! Thank you so much!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I really need indepth statistical knowledge for applications from a Proficient Tutor even if it's within a short period of time as I can learn anything fast if I am serious and really interested. Not all these confusion they're giving us in school.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The fascinating part is I took this course 30 years ago and it’s all flooding back.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
hocam kralsınız

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you so much MIT OCW and Professor Strang! Huge fan! Hugs from Brazil!

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Your teaching is amazing. I am a teacher myself and I know that teaching is not easy but it seems very easy to you. Thank you for these videos. I am very grateful for them :)

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I like how he calls vectors or columns "this guy" and "that guy"

### 14. Poisson Process I
process has memorylessnessf property (provided the person entered the room doesn't see the future)   
continuous time variations    
definition of the poisson process and we use the concept of memorylessness in here
time homogenity as time is continuous.
Lambda*Tau will be the rate at very small interval
diff time slots are independent of each other 
NUMBER of arrivals in the disjoint time interval will be independent of each other.

delta is very small.
pmf have the binomial pmf
here we are taking a big interval and we are splitting that interval into many infinitesemely small interval.

now prob of one of the intervals will be same as the bernoulli distriubution
for poissson we take lambda tends to 0.
merging of the poisson process

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I suggest every colleges' linear algebra course using this course video. Prof Strang makes linear algebra so intuitive, interesting and easy to understand. He plots the pictures and tells you what's going on in the vector space and then he will go back to the theory to make you have a deep comprehension

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
@ 24:30 why is row operation able to preserve row space and not column space? as Prof Strang mentioned that 111 can longer be found in C(R) so column space is not preserved. However, I don't see any row in A being found in R as well?. To put my question simply, how do I know if certain space is preserved after certain operation?

### 25. Classical Inference III
Yayy

### 16. Markov Chains I
I'm interested in this but the application is more as predictive software that can take the data that's collected and make predictions based on everything my question comes in at is it possible to use several other programs I guess like they use in Linux pipeline many large programs together to create a super program I'm interested in a program that can predict everything from everywhere and trying to get the predictive error down to less that 1 percent

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
use the chen lu!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I love this man

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
isnt first and third quadrant of x-yplane together a subspace of R2 ?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
1. ? 2. 21:49 3. 40:00 4. 39:49 5. 47:13

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Amazing lecture. Great

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
yeah of course the lecture is more older than me

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Just saying.
He says that the additivity axiom needs strengthening, and uses the same to prove that P(A) <= 1.
Does he mean to say that the axiom is correct but needs more depth of explanation?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is lectue 34?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Making my day

### 34. Final Course Review
I completed the whole course today, 2021.08.27
Can't remember when I started, but the first chapter gave me a bunch of intuition and those encouraged me to keep studying until the end of the course
Thank you, Prof. Gilbert Strang. You are my great Mathematics teacher. You inspired me to keep moving on these pieces of stuff
I really hope that I can meet you one day

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
TY

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Please excuse me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but when I took the determinant of matrix A at the end, I got 9, not 3. Because I got det(A)=2(3)-3(-1)+3(0)=9. I'm really hoping someone can help me out.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

at runtime 36.40 mins, why cant a horizontal line be a perpendicular to vertical vector and why it must be a horizontal plane instead ?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you for uploading this video. You've made linear algebra 100x easier

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
if i had this class........   i would fail it.

### 4. Counting
Nice hair cut ;) And great lecture of course!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Everytime I'm stuck in a problem I should ask myself "What would MatLab do?"

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Means the curve itself,is a mirror integral

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

thanks :)

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I swear, these lectures with the Schaum's Outline of Linear Algebra can really help anyone learn the subject.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
What does 'when A is singular' mean at 29:00?

### 12. Time Complexity
For what major would this course be taken for?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
We're using Professor Strang's book in my linear algebra class and I really cannot understand my professor's teaching style. My friend pointed me to these lectures instead and I already feel like I actually understand a lot more from this one lecture than I have the past two weeks in my class. Thanks Professor Strang!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
The column by row example at around 14 mins really hit home with the whole linear combination point. Something so simple can flick a switch in your head so it all makes sense, so kudos.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I remember him!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I heartily agree!  When I took linear algebra at Penn State in winter term 1976-7, I had such a hard time with it.  I think now it was the approach (too analytical) and the lack of time I put into the concepts (too much time on details).  I don't like getting so much thrown at me.  I like to mull over the concepts and place them into my longterm memory.  Cliff Notes also help!

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
X value - any value on a graph's horizontal axis
Y value - any value on a graph's vertical axis
slope - the value which is the change of x and y values between two points
tangent line - the slope of a curve at any given single point.

In this video he estimated the tangent line by looking at how the graph curved in that area. (Geom. Interp.)

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Thanks a lot MIT OCW for this free lectures.and i am grateful to MIT for introducing the TEACHER Mr. Gilbert to the world. I wish him happy and healthy life. You are a wonderful teacher. Thanks.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
In the middle of my PhD, with all the stress, Dr. Strang's lectures are the only relaxing time I have. Nothing else really feels so great. What a legend. I wish I could attend his lectures physically.

### 16. Markov Chains I
A million times better than my professor

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
tan and arctan has the same slope at 0 as opposed to the drawing at 38:30.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you is not enough to express how lucky we get to access to this great lecture! Still, thank you Prof Strang and MIT :')
And cheers to those who appreciate knowledge up to this point!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I am not so clear about why the R in CR is sure to be a basis, how to make sure that it's independent?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thanks MIT And Prof . Gilbert Strang!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
What is meant by "basis"?

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
I expect that Professor Strang could explain the rank decomposition for calculating the pseudo-inverse. Damn time limit.

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
MIT really needs to change those blackboards to something more modern.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Lecture 33 Exam 4 review From Your

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am from the Dominican Republic , 
Thank you very much to MIT Open courses.
we are using yours Lectures at the rural area of Barahona city  wich is at the South area from Santo Domingo. 
Thank you very very much.
God Bless all of you.!!!!

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
So cool to see

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
16:57 bless u

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
At 19:50 he said "When is a line through the origin orthogonal to whole plane? Never" but I think if we take any line through origin and a plane whose normal vector is parallel to that line then they both will be orthogonal. For example x-axis and y-z plane. Help me out please.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When I got a problem as a student in Maribor from the USA to help solve a problem from postgraduate studies and after I solved it in 5 minutes I never watched what Americans do in mathematics.1986-7
This professor is a classic European mathematician and not to teach you how to solve everyday problems symbolically so that you are cool.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
this one lecture covers most of my math and control engineering module. guys a genius

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the class is so rambunctious.. it must be that sexy french accent

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
@[USERNAME]i assume he just did this one again for the recording! maybe the regular recording got somehow screwed up!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice lecture, thanks mr auroux

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Watching this in 2019. Revising for Machine Learning. That guy is brilliant

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Greatness at its maximum expression.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What a wonderful professor! May God bless his soul.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the way Americans keep on saying that they did this when they were 15-16 ext.
But then Michio Kaku say's that America sucks rhinoceros balls at science. Anyone see the discrepancy?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I started watching this back in April as a college freshmen and it inspired me to study and take my first actuary exam.   I passed this September.  Thank you MIT

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Where can the problem set of 30 questions that he mentioned be found?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
After the first lecture, I was expecting to see the Gauss method to emerge along the same kind of ideas. Something like, we look for a transformation that turns the vector multiplied by x into (1, 0, 0). This reduces the dimensionality of the problem. We repeat the procedure until we arrive at az = b, and then we roll back. Well, I guess, we all have our preferences.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof Strang, hope to meet u in person one day.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
31:42 A doesn't have an inverse because Ax=0 can't recover the vector 3,-1 on multiplication by A inverse if it existed. Why does Prof Strang find this such a compelling illustration that A doesn't have an inverse?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
It's a .... superbowl 

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
His lecture is very good. But his lecture is not complete. He didn't prove the fact that n eigenvectors are linearly independent if the matrix A has n different eigenvalues. He lectured only the case in which the eigenvectors are linearly independent. He always omits difficult cases.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
Such an amazing presence of mind and sharpness at 84 years old ... Respect to Prof Strang

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is teacher French?

### Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
Hi, I would like a sandwich with x

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
great material!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
The best joke of all occurs at 19:00.

“Five minutes of 18.06 is enough to take care of 18.03.”

And it’s not a joke, provided you have a thorough understanding of 18.06.


### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't understand it until I saw the chains.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I am a graduate student majored in electrical and computer engineering. Though most of us have learned linear algebra in undergraduate study, I would like to highly recommend this course to those who are interested in machine learning and signal processing. Thank you Prof.Strang!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
This man is a wonderful Guru

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
At 43:46, what if you chose a different slice in the xz plane? Wouldn't df/dx change because you would get different curves? Or, would all the curves be the same general shape: a parabola, making it not change after all? Thanks.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Any one here at 2020?

### 16. Markov Chains I
I'm taking the course Probability (EDX MITx) which really worth it. His book is one the best. Introduction to probability, highly recommended.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yo tambien soy de Mexico y estudio en EU. En EU eres forzado a tomar 2 semestres de matematicas, pese a que no sean necesarias en tu carrera. Muchos estudiantes que estudian ingles o politica deciden llevar este curso porque es de los mas sencillos, otros porque quieren "refrescar" los temas, u otros porque quieren un promedio alto. El curso se volvera complicado, por ejmplo no recuerdo haber visto la regla de l'hopital en Mexico, pero como dicen, todo depende en la persona, no en nacionalidad.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
you're awesome professor thank you.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"Ok, so...that's the end."  haha....ends just as matter-of-factly as he began.  How poetic.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you Lord that I saw these lectures now. It's a shame that is late, but it happened none the less. God bless you Professor Strang

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
수강 날짜: 21 Oct

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are you kidding me right we do lim at 16 Years old in Greece and you make it in MIT............-.- pffff ok.........

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is the text book important? Besides the recommended text book “Edwards, Henry C., and David E. Penney. Multivariable Calculus. 6th ed. Lebanon, IN: Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130339676.“, is there any other text books good for this course?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
8:05

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the polar coordinates explanation and how the non-rectangular region can be treated as rectangular in the limiting case.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't have the pleasure of attending MIT, but I think MIT professors are the best. Including this guy.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I Really Like The Video From Your Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane approximation

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
I wish Strang was my grandfather

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Superb video. Amazing

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
ok I'm still not fully understanding how to get the equation of the plane at about 10:30  he tells about it but i must be missing something anyone wanna give me an example?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
He is the most Amazing teacher .The way he shares the knowledge it becomes very easy understand and imagine which is a beauty of his teaching

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
"...perhaps we're splitting hairs here, but perhaps it's useful to keep the concepts right."  I have always wanted to have a Professor like him.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Emergency question! Can we describe a basis for non-subspaces? For example a plane doesn't go through the origin???

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
dat MIT chalk

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I love the videos, i understand the english but some cuts no, but I like

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]as I mentioned, there is no floating point exactitude for the circumference of a circle.  It all rests on the work of Dedekind and his attempt to create continuity in the number line by using his Dedekind Cut.  Even if his logic holds true, it only holds true for a straight line.  It does not hold true for a curve.  You would again be stuck with limits and tangent lines.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
What a Guy!

### 14. Regression (cont.)

Maybe we can come up with a linear algebra hip-hop artist. We might call her/him PosDef.

*me and my ho's, we like to transpose...*

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Mister Alan Edelman if you can hear me .   Would it be possible to implement "physical datatypes" which contains value as well as unit. wehre for example units wood be as well multiplied as values (in Multiplications)  i think this would also be a great relief. i for my self work with quantum mechanics and units are always a problem. i try to implement the above explained concept in python

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Because of the extensive amount of programming I've done with OpenGL, I feel that the axis are all messed up x.x... I like z-axis positive direction to be "out" and x-axis positive to the right, and y-axis positive up.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
He always asks permission from some unseen student in the sky that only he can hear:  “can I give an example here?  OK, can I try this?”  It’s a pleasure to take his course.

Phenomenal teacher.....  He has the ability to covey concepts in a very clear and understandable way.  Wow....what a joy to learn from him.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
3 good lectures so far, but I'm questioning my will to live with this delivery.  I'm not really interested in ANYTHING this guy is saying.  If you're not going to be examined on the first 15 minutes of dross, why lecture on it?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

This article is about mathematicians finding that the fastest way to multiply is n*log(n) steps versus the usual n^2.
https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-discover-the-perfect-way-to-multiply-20190411/ Professor Strang shows you how that is in this lecture.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I always dreamed (and still continue) about studying at MIT, but I am not a genius and not a daughter of some deputy, so instead of university lectures I watch this course and imagine myself studying there))

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Electric current flows from (+) to (-), from higher potential to lower potential. But starting node of each edge is marked with -1 in the matrix and end node marked with +1. Why not other way around?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Style ❤️

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
Not sure why this professor sounds always angry, and keeps hitting the chalkboard as much as he can like trying to release his childish anger. Other than that, he is OK. Sorry to say, my GaTech professors were 10x better than this. e.g check out Prof.  D.Goldsman.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The mic noise and hiss is distracting in this lecture, I hope someone could fix it ..

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The last problem is easier if you take the derivative (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ)  and then use L'Hospital's Rule, rather than using Taylor expansion

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
...and, where do you think that software came from? What do you you think is running the Google search engine? Why does the jpeg file format exist and is widely used? You probably need to open your mind to applying math to some field and not limit your thinking that what you learn in a math class is all you need to pay your bills.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
I found it very helpful to first go through Chapter 7.1 - Image Processing by Linear Algebra, from the Introduction to Linear Algebra by Strang, Fifth Edition. At first, I could not catch on with the lecture even though I have seen most of his past lectures and read the book. 7.1 really helped me.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Where is lecture no 28?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
💛💛

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]Maybe a simpler example helps. We take the X axis as one subspace and the Y axis as another subspace. So the union of those two spaces is all vectors on either axis, but nowhere else. For example (1 0 0) is on the X axis and (0 1 0) is on the Y axis. But the sum of the (1 1 0) is not on either of those lines. It's outside of it, so the union can't be a subspace, as otherwise you'd stay inside it when you add two vectors.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not at all (assuming you are about in the top 10%).  The people at MIT have shown dedication, interest, ingenuity as well as being fairly clever.  Most students at top universities are not brilliant at all.  They are simply hard better students.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
i hope this professor doesnt get any sexual assault charges with that much winking because his lectures are awesome.

### 8. Undecidability
Check-in 8.1> b! Even the logic we use is arbitrary but math is just deduction from arbitrary axioms. The only way you could decide this question is to make it empirical. That is to say, whatever logic and whatever set of axioms we use should be the one that is most predictive of observed experience!

Jesus Christ has done such a genetic replications by volumetric increase in grape juice and in more fishes.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When proving that (1-cosθ)/θ tends to 0 as θ goes to 0 in the geometric interpretation, shouldn't he be using 2θ in place of θ, as he duplicated the theta when he mirrored it upon what looks to be the x-axis? Also why does he look to be using what looks to me like sinθ (the green line that signifies the height of a specific point on the unit circle) when proving that the numerator of the function decreases significantly "faster" than the denomonator, as θ should be the length of the arc from 0 to a specific angle on the unit circle?

Sir, You have shownDOT product applications in very nice order.  Is there any physical significance of DOT Products? Or what does happen when dot product is taken between two vectors? Or is this only a tool facilitating mathematical calculations?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Has anyone else noticed a drop in views?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone can explain the origin of such formula for the circumference of a part of a circle? I mean "a times feita".

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Gilbert Strang is gifted in two ways. Not only he possesses the knowledge and expertise necessary to be a math professor, but also he has the charisma that encourages people to both listen and enjoy what he is talking about.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Look everyone. Here's that douche bag who's either lying or desperately needs attention that you can find on every video of upper level mathematics or science classes.

"The idea of elimination ... I mean you would have thought of it ".It is so funny

### 13. Regression
Why expectation = [Y-(a+bx)]^2,  I think i should be = [(a+bx) -Y ] ^2,   or real value - predict value , maybe it same, so Can I use two formulas?. Can anyone explain it for me? Thanks <3

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Engenvalues go!!!

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Hands Down one of the most intersting lectures, The way Professor showed reseach ideas here and there and almost everywhere just blows me away, It was very very intersting, and best part is it is afforable to non-Math guys too, (thought its coming from a maths guy, however I feel like math part of very little, it was more towards intuitive side of SGD)

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The thing is Calculus seems hard when you first take it, but afterwards when you move on take even higher level classes, you realize that Calculus is just the introduction to higher level math. My favorite math has always been Differential Equations.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule

Lol you kidding me? Thats what I'm learning right now in 11th year

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
@[USERNAME]What I mean, is that around minute 14:00 he says that the error is vertical instead of orthogonal to the line. I thought we were trying to minimize the error by orthogonal projection. I'm probably mixing things up, but I don't see it.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
34:58 would using perpendicular distance (instead of vertical distance) make better sense? 


### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Fundamental ideas ;)
Thanx

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
12:54 Lol professor could actually do that, but a little bit different by instead of the conjugate equation, we can use orginal equation. He actually pointed it out but mistook it a little bit. Just multiply both side of the tranpose equation by x, change A*x to Lambda * x, then we end up with the equation where Lambda = Conjugate(Lambda) . I actually followed his guide that moment and it worked, but he instead ended up with a mess XDD.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
We did this in class one week ago. My sucks ass. This is soooo much better and clearer. This guy should be given "best teacher in the world" award. He should win a noble prize in teacher. All other teachers should bow to him and call him "teacher god!"

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Very useful course! You can learn Linear Algebra yourself! Let knowledge spread to everyone, free and efficiently.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well,you have the slope (m) of the tangent which is -1\x^2
and the equation of any tangent is y-y0 = m(x-x0)

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
if someone could explain what he is saying at 34:35, that would be great. I don't really understand it. I  wish I could be more specific in explaining my confusion!

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
It may be worth to note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

Also, looking at the networks in a more structured manner makes clear that the basic ideas of BPP apply to very general types of neural networks. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights. This is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary linear subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
With the additional text down below this is going to be excessively long. Hence I will stop the itemized previous comments. 

The point is that a sufficiently general, precise and manageable foundation for NNs clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for our paper dealing with Backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

We have developed a completely new deep learning algorithm called Neural Network Builder (NNB) which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable, precise and faster than BPP. 

The NNB algorithm assumes the following guiding principle:
The neural networks that recognize given data, that is, the “solution networks”, should depend only on the training data vectors. 

Optionally the solution network may also depend on parameters that specify the distances of the training vectors to the decision boundaries, as chosen by the user and up to the theoretically possible maximum. The parameters specify the width of chosen strips that enclose decision boundaries, from which strips the data vectors  must stay away. 

When using the traditional BPP the solution network depends, besides the training vectors, in guessing a more or less arbitrary initial network architecture and initial weights. Such is not the case with the NNB algorithm. 

With the NNB algorithm the network architecture and the initial (same as the final) weights of the solution network depend only on the data vectors and on the decision parameters. No modification of weights, whether incremental or otherwise, need to be done. 

For a glimpse into the NNB algorithm, search in this platform our video about : 
NNB Deep Learning Without Backpropagation. 

In the description of the video links to a free demo software will be found. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and Perceptrons Are Functionally Equivalent. 

For the conceptual basis of general NNs in see our article Neural Network Formalism.

Daniel CrespinP

I just read the latest edition of the book for this course and it is brilliant , the best Linear Algebra textbook! Thank you Dr. Gilbert Strang! But I like the cover of older edition with the houses being transformed. Is there any software for online hw for the book? Please let me know.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I love professor Strang's great lectures. 

Just one small correction at 32:30: It should have been S * LAMBDA^100 * c instead of LAMBDA^100 * S * c.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
If James Stewart taught at MIT he'd be Prof. Strang. 

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Absolutely precious! Excellent in explaining details! Thank you.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
can someone explain how he got 24P's at the end?

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
17:10 The word is his name Rigollet in French

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yakınsama olmasa baban kim bilemezdin şerefsiz

### Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators
This is not teaching. This is just copying the textbook to the blackboard and reciting the textbook text. A real teacher would give concrete examples which showed with integers how these functions worked.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Fantastic lecture series!

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow this guys awesome! I hate it when I have professors who don't know wtf they're doing!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thnx sir, I am from Assam, India and I am now in 11th standard

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I love this man the way he teach and connects the subject with reality. .. Last 5 min... 💚

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
▲
Aside from what Professor Strang teaches great, he also has a refined sense of humor. Gauss discovered before us, not only because he lived before us, but also died before us. Well, then, because of the "mistake" in the third row and the second column, when he "promised" A to one of the students at the exam.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Yes high quality! (Veterans of Lecture 4 will understand).

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does the US college start from middle school? Do you guys learn anything before college?

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
GOAT

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
thank you sir.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The proof for why v1,v2,... ,vr are orthogonal means u1,u2,... ,ur are orthogonal by A*v=sigma*u at 23:00.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Great stuff. I was able to do my homework with this lecture. I will definitely be getting Strang's book.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Cheat sheets and notes to tests where do I sign up...👍

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Lecture 4 must have been the "weeding out" lecture for the course. hah

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
The null space consist of those vectors at the end and [0,0,0] but he said at the start, if [0,0,0] is a vector in the space then it's not independent since you can take any coefficient of it and 0 for the others. So how does the nullspace have a basis?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this guy teaches well!

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
i know i know its juvenile but that's what she said  @ 42:34

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This really cleared up some terms I was having trouble with.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I passed Linear Algebra in 1989 but I did it by correspondence. I had no idea really what it was about but I learnt some algorithms to pass the exam! This is better. Now I see to understand it kind of intuitively. I the Maths 1 paper I passed was part of a BA including English Literature, Philosophy etc But I had intended possibly to do mathematics or engineering. It is interesting. As a NZr I keep wanting to tell him to say "zed" instead of "zee". I found this lecture by chance.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good lecture.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Left it on a cliffhanger

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
That is correct, it's not a linear transformation.
For me, it helps to think of this in terms of similar triangles: T(2v) takes two times the original vector but only adds one times v0 to it.  For the resultant vector to be proportional (i.e., =2T(v) ), one would have to add 2v0 to T(2v).

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Gradient Descent is at 34:33

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
I am hoping for a discussion about conventions of derivatives.  Much of the stuff I've seen would make the gradient a row vector, which leads to the derivatives being the transpose of what he shows.  In his example, the derivative a'x is 'a' which is contrary to intuition from single variable calculus though he uses intuition for x'Sx.

V = Q squared.  Well, Q is area (distance squared).  How do you square that and end up with volume (distance cubed) ???

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
who is watching it in 2017 Christmas holidays ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So they learn this at the MIT?
Lol, that's too easy, but thanks for sharing (;

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What TAs stands for?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
i didnt understand this lecture guess i need to read a book....

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Excuse me, does it mean that the basis of the input space and that of the output space is the same {v1, v2, ..., v8} at 45:25?
Then, if this is true, when does change of basis happen?
I get confused here, please help me, thanks a lot!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
it is...

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's a weighted average, so you have to multiply the previous center of mass by the number of blocks, not just compare the center of mass at the previous block to the new block. When you have 2 blocks and add a 3rd, the 3rd block is (2+1)/3=1/3 of the total mass, then the 4th block is (3+1)/4=1/4, and so on.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is the easiest course ever

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
lol im here becaue my calc3 professor at purdue gave the worst 2 course review lectures EVER!! going to do make a ratemyprofesor account just to talk about hiim

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh my, his integral signs are...delicious lol

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

@[USERNAME]
It's because the length of the curve gets closer and closer to the length of the line (infinitely close gives the same length and therefor the ratio between the curve and the line tends to 1) where the linelength = sin x and arclength = x. 

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would personally go up and shake this man's hand after every lecture... he's that damn good

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i'd never learn a thing with this guy as my professor. He's so incredibly boring and doesn't explain things well at all. Half the time he just sayswhat he's writing and then explains none of it

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Hard to tell if this is before or after the exam was sat?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
1:50 My favorite part of this video.

"PERPENDIC||  ULA  ||R"

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in case we had two constraints, x>0 & y>0, should we add another variable for x & y too? i guess in this case when x & y are bigger than 0. this variables(gamma_x,gamma_y) would be 0. thanks in advance

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Still remember the silly definition of a matrix as rows of number? Too silly when all you have encountered was scalars and vectors. Thinking of matrices as rows or columns each of which represents a vector makes all sense and could creatively be used for a variety of applications. A matrix seen as a collection of column vectors represent the basis of a vector space is a great tool to define and compute coordinate transformations. Einstein’s General Relativity could have not existed without such concept. Imagine a continuous transformation of coordinates where each subsequent coordinate change is a differential vector and the transformation is continuous.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is also USA. A very impressive part of it. Sharing wisdom. Thank you professor Strang, and thank you MiT.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
It is an incredible gift to have this course open to the public, truly a service to the world.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
It's always a pleasure listening to lecture of a Legend.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
why he select x2 and x4 as free cols? why not x1,x2 or x1,x3?Why x2,x4 can be free cols and why we can set any values to them?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
16:53. The sequential v. matrix representation of the sample space looks like a game in extensive form and normal form.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Glad to see this posted. Hoping of going to the Eastern Half of Australia next semester so that I can study this.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
I don't understand why E[X_i, X_j] = P(X_1 X_2 = 1). Where does that come from? Also, don't we need to know also P(X_1 X_2 = 0)?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
This man just truly loves linear algebra, and it's fantastic.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
please post the course for introduction to probability! :D thank you for the videos btw!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why is there no Lec 8?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
No words for sir strang ,he is my favorite teacher

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
He didn't finish the example from the previous lecture did he?

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
okay, I know a lot of people have already said this already...but this is from the heart

Thank you MIT

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Allah razı olsun ....

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
this course is normal

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Professor Strang!! You made linear algebra my favourite course this semester :D Love your passion for teaching

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would agree with you were it not for the FACT that MIT is asking not the Chinese, not Europeans, not those in the Southern hemisphere, nor the Northern hemisphere, but specifically Americans to foot the bill to, as you said, increase global standards, help mankind, educate ALL students, blah, blah, blah.  Americans should not be continually asked to sacrifice their own flesh for such endeavors.  Why should I pay taxes to pay for schools who turn out only foreign grads?

intelligence is the possession of knowledge...smartness = good at learning and/or good at applying or using knowledge.

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
Dr. Strang I see this matrix from a finite point of view.  W is a generator 7 and P is 49 with a range 1 to p-1.  
7^8 = 5764801,  5764801 / 48 = 120100.0208,  120100.0208 - 120100 = .0208 3333,  .02080333 (48) = 1.  I suppose this matrix is part of a discrete log problem. finding the exponent in Zp^*.  this matix looks awfully close to the array for finding primitive roots.  If so would numerical sequences that do not have a repeating pattern  of numbers be Eigenvalues.  Could you bring this cluster mess all together and show the short cuts.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do you have the REAL video player. If you don't get that and you will be able to record them. Usually it would only take about 10 minutes or so to record this video for instance. When you are watching a video the REAl logo will be somewhere on the screen click on it and it will have an option to record.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
I am confused about the calculations of variance in the practice example. If the variance is the distance from the mean, it seems to be 1/2(a^2+b^2) instead of 1/2(a^2,b^2).

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations

love it, thanks!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This is making such big difference. My math professor said that we won't have any video lectures while she's teaching. I think this is kinda backwards thinking, because sometimes you can't come to the lecture at the given time, but still need to go through it. If you miss, you're doomed and the more you miss, the more chance there is to fail the class. So this is great. Thanks MIT!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I really appreciate 18.06. It is my first lesson in linear algebra.

Okay, see you wednesday!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Prerequisites??

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone clarify why (at 48:01) he sets sin(θ) ≈ θ  θ^3/6, leaving out the second degree term (θ^2/2) as it seems should have been next according to the Taylor expansion? He doesnt do that when setting cos(θ) ≈ 1  θ^2/2. I keep thinking about it but cant figure out what Im missing.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Dang - He's good!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hello all. I had to watch Khan Academy's Trigonometry videos to get back up to speed with this lecture. The law of sines and cosines didn't stick with me from high school.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Will this course cover jacobian and hessian matrix?Just asking.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I honestly think that his handwriting is really good. It's got it's own swag within itself.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No one bothered to asked him how 2*Xo*Yo turned out to be equivalent to 2. not good.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Gilbret Strang !

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Best teacher of Linear Algebra ever!!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
that asian guy with the time stamps is gone now.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
is sir Gilbert strang still alive??

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
He is literally teaching me my whole class.....maymester is no joke

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
2:15 he begins making a really good point. Start with the symbols...then state what does it mean...then say why it is true. I really don't like how many professors start with proofs. They lose students

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
The students in the lecture are truley showing great self-control cause if I were taking this class I would be cracking up incessantly.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
22:03 "Where in calculus, you really, you know, you're trying to visualize these things, well 2 or 3 dimensions is kind of the *_limit_* ..."
Professor Gilbert Strang: Come for the fantastic teaching, stay for the fantastic puns.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Basics of vector calculus understands properly.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
although i really admire MIT OCW, what bothers me is that the majority of videos covers easier undergraduate stuff. i would like to see more advanced lessons if there are any filmed.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
If we take the matrix A times with the zero vector of R^4, do we get a four-dimensional space ?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Great lesson from a  humble Professor with a sense of humor.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I guess this is why MIT is the best. 

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
There is an important piece of information missing in the lecture; The fact that any particular solution p_i is reachable from another particular solution p_j + some combination of nullspace. Now one can claim that all solutions are included in x_p+x_null

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
What a beast.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
What a brilliant lecture !!!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
Thank you so much Professor Strang and MITTTTT, my best summer friendddd! yahoo! Linear Algebra!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really great professor

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Great point on comparing matrix Nuclear norm with vector L1 norm, which tends to find the most sparse winning vector. I guess the matrix Nuclear norm may tend to find 'least' weights during the optimization.

### 4. Counting
עכשיו אני בוגר הנדסת אלקטרוניקה. אָמֵן

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I just want to say to all those guys watching this series on linear algebra to checkout 3blue1brown essence of linear algebra first then come back to this again . 3B1B videos literally helped me understand these videos in much easier way with much less efforts.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
at 10:00 he says "columns of C are combination of columns of A"
I think is might be mistake there..  it should be like  "columns of C are combination of rows of A"..
if no then please clear my doubt

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
humbled and honored to learn from you sir.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
HAHA, every single video has different white balance and contrast. I've never seen the same room so many different ways.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How is one to know what each lecture is on?

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's not that what he's teaching is wrong or anything he its just that he gives no motivation for why he knows this, why there is a need for it and what the intuition is. That is valuable for students who are knew to this & 5 minutes on the intuition connected to previous knowledge is better than 50 mins of confusion.

He's a good teacher but I think most people would have to be already familiar with the concept to appreciate any of it, most would go to khanacademy videos to get the intuition :p

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Why the skew-symmetric matrix have zero or imaginary eigenvalue?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yeah word me too... wtf

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It mentions it once because that was on the schedule. And partial derivatives aren't related to partial differential equations? Then I guess variables aren't related to algebraic equations.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The first year(s) of Uni are very similar in work to A levels and equivalent qualifications

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]

Lol, you must accept one or the other, but not make an explanation about how you can get to that point from simpler math.

I agree, it would have made it simpler, but I'm not complaining because this is as simple as it gets in a college lecture. Maybe it's somewhere else on the internet.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hm, MIT got  good chalks... =O

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
chalkboards!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Great professor, great human!

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
I'm so excited! I'm now at the tail end of a Master's program for Data Science in part due to Dr. Strang's linear algebra lectures. My future job heavily uses CNNs and I get to keep improving with Dr. Strang. I literally owe him my livelihood. <3

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Truly amazing how professor Strang keeps on teaching despite his age.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Who would have guessed, when this guy explains it, it almost sounds easy! You, dear dr. Strang, are a master at what you do...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How is |C|^2 = (A-B) ???

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Simple made perfect.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Why are we throwing out the column three? I mean we reduce any column to zero by elimination. C1 = C3 - C2  and   C2 =  C3 - C1 . Can somebody explain this please?

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Thanks professor ! It really really helps understanding 3D computer vision works.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yes

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lectures makes the idea of linear regression crystal clear.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
his chalk on the blackboard sounds are just so satisfying 😍 why doesn't all chalk sound like this??

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
listening to those lectures while studying networking is my new hobby, am I okay?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
He just non-chalantly planted the idea of Group Theory in at the very end of the lecture - Genius!
If only one can make a math playlist of all the best lecturers in the world... may be I will do this.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Who needs live teachers anymore when you can just see the whole thing on youtube?
Why pay them to give the same class over & over? 
You can just watch whenever you want.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Although the audio is low in this video, DR. Strang relay the information on differential equations and exp(At) very well. Matrix exponential is very important in linear systems.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
graduated with a degree in data science, I still have to be here

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I feel like a kid on christmas ;)
I have enjoyed his Lin. Algebra and the CSE course so much, I can't wait till I find the time to do this course!

Thumbs up from Bavaria!

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
you are amazing!~

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Prof Gilbert Strang is a legend by his own right!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
100 students in a class. each pay 50USD a day aprox for university. perhaps 25USD for this lecture alone. (2500USD total!) 
And we get it for free!
This really helps those without opportunities to learn and advance.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this can't be ther full course their not even done differentiation yet.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Good job sir I am also math teacher in india

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I found it more interesting and time saving for me to watch these lectures on 2x speed.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Gilbert Strang's lectures are wonderful and have saved me in several classes where they (were supposed to) teach the same stuff!  I'll most definitely keep watching anything he teaches.  I did, however, cringe when he put an equal sign between Q0R0 and R0Q0 :-(.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Thank you!..every thing makes sense now!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
It's great that there are over 100000 views even on the 5th video. I'd like to think that it's because people just love learning and discovering math, but probably most people just need it for a class. Still, it's good that people are learning these things.

### 16. Markov Chains I
Is he Markov? :P

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
My work doesn't require linear algebra, so I'm studying this to understand what my colleagues are up to and how some of the instrumentation I work with operates.  After looking at the textbook I thought this would be over my head, but the lectures are excellent. Plus, there is no stress in this course or in the presentation.  When I don't understand something I would look it up on line elsewhere, but that wasn't often necessary.  In other lectures we get the mechanics, but not enough to go through understand the concept behind the mechanics.  

I stop either before or after a new concept is presented and try to play with the example matrix on a piece of paper trying to figure out the next bit of the lecture before Prof. Strang explained it.  More than half the time I was wrong, but I got it enough times to gain confidence. In order to make the matrix manipulations easier I did all the calculations for each entry  in row by column dot products.  This made for a messy piece of paper, but avoided arithmetic errors and communicative multiplication errors.  After doing this, my error rate went way down.

Thank you. MIT!  Thank you Professor Strang!
(Suggested retitle: James Stewart teaches Linear Algebra.  It's like listening to Elwood P. Dowd.  A gentle explanation that makes me happy just listening to it. What's not to like? )

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's pleasure to learn maths from an MIT professor

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
My favorite way to inverse a matrix of any n×n is to find its determinant (to make sure that it can inverted), then write an augmented matrix such that aug(A)= [A | I] and do row reduction until you get aug(A)= [I | A] where the A on the righthand side of aug(A) is the inverse of A, if the matrix is invertible that is. xD

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I came back to this after seeing a Domain/Codomain description of subspaces in row perspective/column perspective tied to the rank-nullity theorem.  This is so much clearer than the introduction I had to this material.  I would love to see his description of the link between row rank/col rank

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
his chalk work is beautiful, smooth

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt

Thank you OCW and Prof. Aureux.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
He made it easy to understand!

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
@[USERNAME]how did he get rad 5 so quickly. I heard “16-11” I don’t know how he got the 16. If he used the quadratic formula, that was some light speed calculation of b^2-4ac, sqrt, and divide by 2

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Who can guess where the next black board might come from.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I hope I saw this lecture way more earlier! Just amazing and fun! :)

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
airplane example was awesome ....

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
He got me when he said: "can I just right [ IF]"

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
Even though the lectures cover same material as the textbook, it's nice to listen to the lectures for additional insights that aren't written in the book.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
It does help to have a geometric view of it. Great lecture!

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Prof Jerison! 18.02SC here I come!

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally done with the course, was a pleasure learning from you baguette man, worth the hundred hours.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Would be nice to make an insight on the functions over random variables. If i have Y=e^X for example

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Hello, if anyone is aware where it's possible to access those Julia homework assignments, which Prof. Strang mentiones, I would appreciate if you can let me know :)) thanks in advance (it's not on course official page unfortunately)

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
When I observe a human being like that developing his profession, I have the mind that it would be difficult for me to establish a corelate value of salary for a being like that. What metrics I would have to use to in no time fail to be fair with the exception value of it.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
it is the first time that I have made sense of the determinant's meaning, great!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
is there any material i can use to practice by myself i can find anywhere?

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why my teacher is not like him!!!????

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
I think the formula for the derivative of a singular value is wrong because d sigma/dt is a diagonal matrix and U^T dA/dt V is not in general. 
The mistake comes because dU^T/dt U + u^T dU/dt = 0 and not each term separately.   The correct formula is d sigma/dt = diag(U^T dA/dt V), the diagonal the stated result.

DR. Strang your first Quiz is very challenging. Professor Strang it  seems to me that you force the students to think about linear algebra in an abstract  sense, however solving problems from the text book should help each student to perform well on quizzes and exams.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is it that the integration of x^2 turns out to be 1/3 when the series divided by n^3 is Less than and greater than 1/3. I did not understand this part, if any of you could explain I would be really grateful

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I have one doubt. If EA = U where E is elimination matrix and U is upper tringular , then det(EA) = det(E)*det(A) = det(U). However at property 7 it was discussed that we first carry out elimination , get U and then use property 7 since it is easier that way and determinant of U will be same as A. That's only possible if det(E) = 1 (by using property 9). Is that always the case?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Thx.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
@[USERNAME]you are still wrong it’s 3.3 not 33

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You only need to go as deep as you care to.  Exactitude in any application is never without uncertainty.  Most things are non-linear, which from an exactitude standpoint equals infinite infinities. Sorta hard to put in numbers you can apply to something.  Though infinity is a useful thing, it's hard to describe something tangible accurately with infinity.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Thanks M.I.T. for making these lectures available to us. It is enlightening to see such talented teachers teach. It is mentally stimulating to think about these concepts. It is satisfying to learn.

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
I forgot how to integrate that final integral on stick breaking example. LOL

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Randomness is relative, it does not have a absolute meaning. It is wrong to say that something is random or that something is not random. You could say that something is more random or less random depending on the criteria that is being used. You could even eventually consider a scale do measure "randomness" depending on the outcome distribution type of a variable.  The true meaning of "randomness" would be, for instance, a discrete variable whose possible outcomes have EXACTLY the same probability of happening. The more random a discrete variable is the more likely it's outcome distribution follows a certain type (independently of the specific values that it will assume). A uncertain outcome of a discrete variable may reveal or prove itself as being more or less random considering the type of outcome distribution that it will take. All the exercises that are done resolving binominal, polinominal, multinominal, call them what you want distributions are assuming that all possible values of a discrete variable have exactly the same probability/chance of happening. In other words they' re assuming that the variable is actually random to it's fullest extent. The truth is that the correct answer to these problems is only theoretic because in application it would be impossible in most cases to replicate randomness. This would mean that the actual practical, real life answer to all these exercises would have to consider a more likely convergent distribution type in comparison to the more likely theoretic random distribution type. A random variable is indeed a variable but should not be initially considered random until  proven, through a certain number of trials (the more the better),  to have a more likely theoretical random outcome distribution type . A random variable could be associated with a function (with no input values and with a given range of possible outcome values that follow a certain distribution type).  The possible values that a discrete variable could take doesn't necessarily have to be numbers. They could be anything including shapes, colors, objects, symbols. In other words they could represent anything. This would be the big difference compared to continuous variables.Take the example of dices that, as everybody knows, assume the following outcomes "1,2,3,4,5,6". You could consider the numbers as being symbols and not numbers. In this particular case the outcome values "1,2,3,4,5,6" could be looked at as being symbols without any arithmetic value. In this case any correlation between the sequence of these symbols and their distribution should be seen as a coincidence. Meaning that there is no sense to calculate the mean or the variance in this particular case, because there is no arithmetic correlation value between symbols or things independently of a more or less random outcome.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
7:50 Nondeterministic behavior.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
hey folks, It went smooth for me until min. 36, though I am stucked there.
I was thinking Taylor Series Expansion is a quadrization around a Fixed Point, and Mr. Strang simply uses the t = 0 as the fixed point for his linearization.. For what ı know this Expansion should only approximate around the limited neighbourhood of t=0.

Am I mistaken somehwhere ?
How come is this Taylor Expansion a general thing ? How can it represent the whole e^At for all t ?

I always feel the homework and exam problems are a lot harder than what he covers in lectures. I don't have a problem with that - just making an observation. This post was meant for those that think MIT is a cakewalk based on the lectures and this review only.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
If A^T A V = V S is the spectral decomposition of A^T A with S diagonal and V orthogonal, we have that (A V)^T (A V)= S. Hence, the nonzero columns of AV, which is associated with the nonzero columns of A, is orthogonal with all other nonzero columns of AV. Hence, is possible to find an orthogonal matrix U such that A V = U sqrt(S) -- note that the diagonal of S give us the squared norm of each column of AV, which means this is completely fine. Now, this means A=U sqrt(S) V^T. Completing U, if necessary, we have the SVD decomposition. In practice, after the calculation of the spectral decomposition of A^T A, we would calculate the Kern of (AV)^T -- orthogonal to Im(AV) -- and find an orthogonal basis to it, and of course, all the singular values associated with this process would be zero.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This lecture is a Tour of Force, every sentence he says, including the ancillary comments, are so well crafted that makes everything click with ease. Least Squares open the gates for the siamese fields of Optimization and Inverse Theory, so every bit of insight he shares has deep implications on those fields (and many others). It's not exaggeration to say that the whole lecture is an aha! moment. Very illuminating, thank you Professor Strang

you are actually claiming to be smart when in fact you sound like a cretin with a chip shared between both shoulders... shut the fuck up..and dont make any comments

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At 26:42, he said Eminem

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Doesn't he make a big mistake in the first example of the video (when he calculates the work done from the field on the particle that is doing the closed path)?

To me it seems as if he completely ignores the effect of the vector field when he calculates c2 and c3, as no mention is made of the look of the vectors and their direction in relation to the trajectory. Instead, as he never gave any algeabric description of the vector field, he implicitly assumes (and I think by mistake) that the vector field is tangent to the trajectory along the entire trajectory (i.e. F dot dr = |F||dr|).

 

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
First, let y=f(kx) and u=kx. This makes y=f(u). Then deploy chain rule so: --- dy/dx = (dy/du).(du/dx). Now compute the derivatives du/dx = k and dy/du = f'(u) Therefore, y' = k f'(u) substitute back in u=kx. This gives - y' = k f(kx). Hope this helps. : )

In french : Une tête de premier de la classe !

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why can you just multiply a row by a certain number, and then subtract that multiplied row from another row AND keep the original row in the next step matrix?  Also, why can you multiply the pivots to find the determinate?  

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
When a function has absolute value you recreate the function making it with multiple branches depending the number of absolute values.And then you differentate it.
Also Propably your function will not be differentiable where the function changes through the branches.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Also interesting is the num of watching from 1st episode to the last one, what’s the distribution? Is that a exponential decay?

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Again, I wish I had a calculus professor like him........instead of professors writing and teaching calculus using their own textbook purely with mathematica....it was so hard for me to get the intuition when I was in college...

After watching this course, I wonder if the linear algebra I studied in college was of the same discipline...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
nice lect


### 34. Final Course Review
@[USERNAME]
I would recommend Bob Proctor as your linear algebra professor. He may not be qualified to teach math specifically, however he understands math is nothing more than adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. He will also get your mind in harmony to achieve good grades.

### 14. Regression (cont.)
It really feels like if you know more,  you can get more from this class. Many thanks~

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Man that joke in the last 😂😂😂😂

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
40:45 its a shame to see that such a brilliant professor  is teaching a class of 0 strength, this is sad,really sad

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
It's funny how courses at a more prestigious university is somehow easier to understand.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why are there no students in the class? They have such great professors and students who attend classes! Unimaginable!!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Goood

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Crazy how this course is not even as difficult as University of Toronto's equivalent multivar. calc class :O

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Vaggos2195 thats why Greece is bankrupt.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great lecture.  why on earth do they clap every single time he erases something ! 

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
might want to add that x-1 is a natural number

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I think the reason why Professor Strang's courses are so popular lies with his personality. He is very considerate so he would try all means to find a way to explain linear algebra concepts easy to understand. This is the same at workplace. Nice people who always take other people's feelings into account tend to provide popular products and services. Some professors offer hard-to-understand, unpopular courses since they don't care about how their students feel at all. They mainly care about whether they are promoted or receive more funding.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Group. They are a nice little GROUP.

### 18. Bayesian Statistics (cont.)
❤️

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Do you know what "to execute" means? It's not a monosemic word. The context within which it is used here is entirely appropriate:)

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Why is it necessary that the subspace P or L of R^3 must go through the origin [0,0,0]???

What if this plane P doesn't go through the origin? Isn't it still a subspace???

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is multivariable calculus actually hard 
i love his french accent but man i understand less and less of what hes saying as we go deeper into the lectures

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very good lecture!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I didn't understand x at @38:00.
Is it a mixed column or one randomly picked? Thanks.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Where did I claim to be smart? I never explicitly claimed to be smart, I only said MIT is not worth 100K a year, which is undeniably true

### 18. Properties of Determinants
thanks proffesor


### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Coolest chalkboard ever.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Woooow explica bastante bien, es muy claro y lo hace interesante, muchas gracias

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Like an idiot, I just realized that all this available on the MIT webpage. I think I'm migrating there.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I always found it hard to grasp the concepts of limits, especially when it looked like 0/0 but I learned that you should never think of it as 0/0 because really, that is an undefined number and what is important is that the quantity in the limit tends towards 0, infinity or some other number for that matter.

The professor should maybe have emphasised this when addressing the students question about sin(dx)/dx -> 1 because sin(0)/0 is really an undefined number.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
:0

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Engineering students must love this

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
35:36 I found it disrespectful, why on earth is erasing blackboard worth laughing at?????????

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
This type of differentiation seriously blew my mind! :-))) Something that I think can be seriously seriously useful. A bit difficult though to understand it right from this presentation.... 

Where this technique should really score is when you need to do derivatives on numerical functions that you cannot really differentiate by calculus to get high accuracy derivatives. Meaning for example calculating derivatives for parameters when using ode solvers and other alike stuff.

For those you would have to either do finite difference approximations which are quite bad (and meaning also simulating the ode twice at least, thus effectively doing same amount of calculations) , or well how on earth would you calculate an analytical derivative for the whole chain of operations? This would be rightout crazy it seems yet maybe not impossible ... ? 

Is there any comparison for how well the differentiation method performs with the log function which is calculated as a continued fraction? I mean how accurate is the dual component of log(x_dual) compared to 1/x?  And in case 1/x is better would it then make sense to implement a custom derivative part returning 1/x to the dual component?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice videos, good exam reviews. Too bad interval of convergence wasn't covered, R can be easily found by the Ratio test most of the time so it was surprising to see it not covered.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:23 In the u-v coordinates, should the parallelogram still be referred to as Delta A, instead of Delta A'? 

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Just came here from 18.06. I'm so excited :)

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Beautiful connection to the cycle space of a graph. Thank you!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thumbs up this video because the vectorial product is positive

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Got extremely confused when he brought transformations in at the end. Why did the original basis vector "x" change to "v", then why does he compute a T(x) from "knowing" T(v1), ... T(v8) BEFORE writing what the actual values of T(v1) .. T(v8) are, and what is this T(x) even used for? and then where does the "a" come from?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
17:30 that guy just gave a thumb down to the professor. Such disrespect.

### 4. Pushdown Automata, Conversion of CFG to PDA and Reverse Conversion
49:35 I don't think this example language actually does require nondeterminism? If you just pop everything that matches the current input and push everything that doesn't, and accept if the stack is empty at the end, it should still work. For example, the stack for the sample input (011110) would go 0 -> 01 -> 0 -> 01 -> 0 -> empty. I would try and write out the mathematical notation but I don't have the best grasp on that yet...

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Bravo.

### 11. Recursion Theorem and Logic
Companion of this lecture, could be this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he teaches so fast that i would feel like a dumbass if i asked a question

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
wowwwwwwwwwwww!!!u are amazing sir

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
DR. Strang, this is another fantastic lecture on the Convolution Rule and how it's applied in the real world. Fast Fourier Transform has play important role in convolution over time. Convolution is useful because of Fast Fourier Transform. Convolution is also very useful in Signal and Systems Theory, which is part of Electrical Engineering.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That guy writes mad fast.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
23:54 lmfao

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
He gives the lecture like the place isn't almost empty

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
My left ear feels lonely....

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
What is the thinking or thought process of NOT doing operation on x in A*x =b . What is the reason behind it? every row operation i do on A is also done on B but not done on x . WHY?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Would I be wrong if I remark that one can think of the Gauss-Jordan as being Gauss applied once, the rows being flipped and Gauss then applied again?

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow. 2:17, the chalk on the board is very pleasing to the eye.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
And thus it became immortal

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I wish he was my teacher.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
vay amk

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thanks so much for the lecture. Professor Strang is a teacher that devote his heart to educate people , thanks to him I have been progressing in the field of Linear Algebra.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
just tell me what i said ::))

### 11. Recursion Theorem and Logic
Incredibly fascinating! Probably the best course I have seen on this channel.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Nice tie prof <3

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He donesn't even need any notes! legend

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Any chance someone could help me out with this?  I posted this on a separate MIT conditional probability video where scenario was: "1 blue marble 4 red in Cup A vs 3 blue 2 red in Cup B" and conditional probability of picking from cup A given there is blue marbe was said to be 1/4" because you add all of the blue marbles for denominator and add up those blue marbles in Cup A for the numerator.

But I'm wondering if let's say I have 1 and only 1 marble in cup A, and it's a blue marble, and say 5 out of 11 marbles in cup B are blue marbles.  It feels like if I know I picked a blue marble, then there should be more than a 1/6 chance of that marble coming from cup A.  I guess because since cup A i this case is 100 percent blue?  I don't know...

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Feels like I know everything well in lecture, but as I sit to do the exercises I can't solve most of them. Is it worth continuing?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The best thing I like in his teaching style is that he picks everything from very basic. I have attended many lectures and classes, and I personally feel that people lack this; they make things more complicated unnecessarily. Kudos to MIT for this beautiful series. I remember one famous quotation by one of the best teachers that "Everything is simple and interesting if it is properly conveyed."

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
This is another fantastic lecture by the grandfather of linear algebra. Symmetric and Positive definite matrices pops up in systems and control engineering.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No. Calculus is easy as long as your prerequisite algebra and geometry skills are tight.
Make sure you know how to solve equations, graph functions, know geometry theorems and have a good base in trigonometry and the calculus is a breeze.

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah the result at 41:40 should be 5/32 or 15,6 %.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
In 17.03, Why UU transpose is symmetric?

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A counter example to what?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
He reveals the beautiful face of Math. I am not only learning but also I am really enjoying it. Thank you

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
people shouldn't at 46:39 it should be e^0 since the limit is equal to 0. If you use direct substitution you get that 1/any number approaching infiniti will always be equal to 0, and so 1+ that is 1. Therefore, 1 to any power=1, and so you get ln1. That is 0 since e^o=1. So where did I go wrong?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

### 34. Final Course Review
prof strang.. I m 21 ,till this age I did not saw a teacher like .u r awesome.. I started loving Linear algebra. I don't have money to give anything to this open courseware but I can only give blessings from my side.. u r genious.. I hope I could be 0.001 percentage of you!!.. I also want to become a teacher like you.. and will serve the nation by imparting beautiful knowledge like u.. thank you prof.. I will go mit for post doc once in my lyff.. love from india😊

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm an economist, but if with this professor, I can also become an engineer in 6 months. I also wonder if these profs take any drawing lessons. His circles are good!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
My term 2 (semester 2) is about to start. There we have maths 2 and to prepare myself for that I am here.My Senior suggested me this.
I am in foundation level (1st year) of IIT MADRAS (India) BS in Data Science and Applications.
Seems good one!
Yet to explore more!
By the way Thanks to Respected Prof Gilbert and MIT.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I remember doing this in high school. It was interesting but so detached from the real world.

### 18. Bayesian Statistics (cont.)
Really is an excellent lecture, helped a lot with my understanding of Bayesian Stats. In the Non-informative priors section, is the unbounded case actually where an improper prior needed?

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MiT students freaked out by Taylor Expansion! I am not alone xD

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is the difference between Vector calculus and Tensor calculus ?

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Well it's quite helpful!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I cannot possibly over-recommend watching the 3blue 1brown series on linear algebra _before_ (or while) watching this series.  It will really make Dr. Strang's material far more clearer.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
thank you, im from germany and our professor sucks.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Can anyone explain, at 31:39, how do we know that v = e^lambda t * v(0)? Where did the v(0) come from?

His hand writing is more clearer than my future

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not even here for learning. I'm an Engineer. I learnt all this in class 12. I just love watching these Math lectures. And I'm trying to revise everything.

The professor here is like the American guy YouTube, for me, an Indian guy. Irony.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
its insane that this video is 15+ years old and still so valuable to someone beginning to learn linear algebra like myself

### 16. Markov Chains I
Where my IIIT Hyderabad people at

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
a great thanx for awesome lesson!

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder if these videos are fair. I go a cheap college that charges me almost nothing. My multivariable teacher isn't very good. So I come here to learn for free. However, those MIT students pay a lot of money for the same education. Is that fair?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 28:10 why are we stuck using (*) to find y.
it seems easily solvable to me?

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
it is so beautiful the way he explains...

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really? Vectors are one of the few things that was useful and didn't pose any problem to me. Examples:
It helped me construct my own the reasoning behind the "domino effect" (if a cloud moves "forward", and is diverted by a mm - vector addition - it will eventually end up in a different place then it should). And my friend used it to program a ball&pad game (ball has a vector, and wall has one two, and when the ball hits the wall, vectors subtract, changing vector=direction of the ball-bounce).

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
And we are so thankful that you did re-record it! :D

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Sir, we miss you so much. happy to see you again!

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is there a dislike -.-

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 28:50 he says, this is a key fact we deduced from Mean Value Theorem (MVT). I don't see how it is so. Can someone explain?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
he really is a fine teacher,  mine just reads off from the book and i'am completely  blank in the end.
your lectures remind me the inspiration i had for choosing maths as my subject

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Great lecturer . Thank you Dr. Strang

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
1.5x speed gang

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Big picture starts at 20:47

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is doing a wonderful job. Keep it up

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
amazing lecture! the best lecture so far

### 15. Poisson Process II
Thank you very much 
I think that there is a missing factor (1-P(0,2)) in the response to the questions d and f. Is this true?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
+MIT OpenCourseWare 
good day, how is that book called which they use for solving problems ? How could we get that books with theory and practics ? Is it possible? Could you share with us?
Thank you so much for these videos

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I don't why I am in Love with this Guy.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
32:00

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is a discontinuity like in that of the function y=1/(x^2) called?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
on the pocket of his shirt, it look like a guy screaming!!! Once you see it, you cant unsee

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
these free videos are well worth the price

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you probably solved it yourself by now, but in case you didn't:
y' is the derivative of the inner function of y with respect to x. So its d/dx (y^2) = (d/dy y^2) * dy/dx which is the same as 2yy' with y'=dy/dx.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why did he label the axes to weirdly? Why did he use z for the vertical axe when he could have just used y to avoid confusion?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
hi teacher

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"this is more than just a dead end; it's a crash, burn AND SELF DESTRUCT"

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
At 39:00

The cost of b is not EXACTLY n^2 operations like he says in the video. 
Yes there are n elements, and we assume that all the elements are non-zero from the beginning. But that doesn't mean that EVERY element are being changed. For this to be true(that we are using n^2 operations) we ALSO must assume that there is no 1's in the pivot positions from the beginning. For example if it were 1's in all the pivot positions from the beginning the cost of b would be n^2 - 100(unlikely, but as an example) So the cost of b is not exactly but CLOSE to n^2.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
At 30:00, Is it silly to consider the vector v as a matrix and to look for the rank ??? I get why the dimension of the subspace is 3, because the 4th component does not bring anything new to the space created by the first 3. BUT I cannot say why it would be wrong to take v as a matrix and say the rank is one !!!!!

It seems I am mixing the dimension of the image created by a single vector, with the dimension of the image created by combination of all vectors v of S. If someone can help :)

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
I just realized that (x, 1) as the dual number is x and the derivative of x as a linear function Ax where A=1.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This was a topic that I found more difficult at University. Had to pause a few times to follow and understand correctly but it was worth it. Really good explanations here.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
thank you so much professor Gilbert Strang. You literally make my day.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I've been using the terms "Closed under..." in two of my midterms now without caring of what it meant exactly graphically...its only now that I understand it. Thanks

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Nice pants cost money, they don't have, because they spend it in research. So they buy cheap pants. Or something like that.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He pushed the floor instead of the board :))
36:13

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
First of, a big thanks for helping me understand the math concepts so much better...Bur really, this could have been explained better by you Mr. professor...Thing is I have been following other MIT video lectures and been amazed at the quality of content presentation. But this particular is not so clearly explained as those other lecture do...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm very grateful to MIT for providing all of this for free. Big thanks from Russia!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love maths ..... but this lecturer is why I hate maths.

You make it so boring

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Professor Strang @ 25:11: "R2 is, we could say, the plane. The xy plane. That's what everybody thinks"
Me: TELL ME YOUR SECRETS!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for posting these lectures. They are serving as a nice refresher course for me. However, am I the only one who is surprised that this is an MIT course? I had a lot of this course content in AP calculus in high school and I was far and away NOT smart enough to be accepted into MIT.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This video gave me TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE!!! I liked it very much,but one thing:Why don’t they use dusters instead of keep on changing the Blackboards?(Just asking in a leisurly way).

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
I guess I will have to read the book

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if S is displacement then dS/dt is velocity... but he defined S as distance so he is correct in saying that dS/dt is speed...

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
so fast that even auto caption cannot catch up!

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lewin draws his dotted lines so much faster

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Really happy at these lectures... Delivered by pro. Strange

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this course must definitely absolutely go on edx.


### 34. Final Course Review
Indeed, you are like a magnet Prof. Strang! I couldn't believe I finished all your lectures. Why doesn't it go on and on... Thank you!

### 12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)
1/2261 I wanna say I feel a little smart. but I am not gonna lie. I am struggling abit lmao. I need to read a stat book after finish up the course.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ive learnt this is school but we don't use delta x. we just say it very simply this just made it confusing.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
The best professor! Thank you so much! Always watch your course to make me keep learning linear algebra!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]Analysis SUUUUCKS! Gosh...

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Sir,
I have seen your linear algebra lectures, read your book on introduction to linear algebra and calculus and now this lecture series. I have learned a lot from you. I would like to express my deep gratitude towards you. Thank you for contributions.

### 34. Final Course Review
Finally reached the end of the course. I am pursuing a career in ML and these lessons have just made the journey a lot easier. There were many concepts I was unable to understand in ML texts. I knew something was missing and that was this course. Thank you MIT. Thank you professor Strang. You are a gift to the world. God bless you.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Having a live audience might help with the occasional  mis-speaks.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I kept listening chalk dots on 39:20

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you very much for these lectures. Through your lectures, I truly understood what I was doing in my PhD three years after completing it.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I Really Like The Video Lecture 18: Properties of Determinants From Your

### Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions
?

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
I really like the video quality. Thank you so much

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Volumes by disks and shells From Your

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]am I subtracting wrong or did he?   For 2*R2 - R3 I got (2*2) - 4, (-2 *2) - 1,(2*6) - 2 => R3 : x = 0, y = 0, z = -5 and 10 on the right side.....he got R3 = 0, 0, 5, -10 ??

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am thoroughly enjoying this lecture! Thank you for uploading this.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I think it great effort

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone explain in Example 1 how he got: y-y0 = (-1/x0^2)(x-x0)).  I understand the calculus part (-1/x0^2), but not the rest of the equation.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Duster ❤️

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
man that kid who asked the question at 25:48 prob dropped the class...

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what accent is this ?

### Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem
It's making me dizzy when camera moves with the movement of professor

### 13. Bernoulli Process
This is the best tutorial every on the subject

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This class sounds amazing, best of two mid terms damn

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
made the lecture entertaining. awesome wish i knew about this lecture earlier.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
last min 10 yr challenge

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
"We need an example here..Let me create an example", He totally doesn't need the text book. aha

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
ok sambil ngantuk

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
If you just put the cut across the three final lines (5, 1 and 8) you also end up with 14. However, is there any reason why you would choose one or the other?

### 4. Counting
Why did I not have a professor like this? It could’ve made my life so easier

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Shouldn't at 13:57, the reflection of [1 0] be in second quadrant and not fourth quadrant

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
To come at this from the other direction, it is easy to see that the vectors in the second "basis" also fail to _span_ R^3 (the other necessary condition to form a basis).  Any linear combination of the three vectors will be of the form (x,x,y), so the vector (1,2,3), for example, is not in the span of the set of vectors.

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
Why did he dust the board like that
White chalk on white background looks bad
Mit can't afford marker boards 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This lecture video is amazing! 

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what happened to lecture 8?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
This is one of the more difficult lectures for me so far. The fact that I didn't fully grasp parametric equations is coming back to bite me up the ass....

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watching this on an iPad haha. Pretty sweet for sure.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally at https://youtu.be/WfEQabCGAqI?t=10m10s the professor has a moment of joy.  Interesting how he chooses to explain using either the phases <projection> or <shadow>

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Makes my head hurt.  What is it good for?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
25:06 So performing row eliminations doesn't change the row space but changes the column space?

So to get the basis for the column space, would you have to do column elimination for matrix [A]? Or could you take the transpose, do row elimination, and just use that row basis for [A] transpose as the column basis for [A]?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Thank's MIT to share this type of documents with the worlds. Thank's...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
28:27 null space

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Omg I just discovered this channel and I didn’t have idea that YouTube have this excellent content. It remember me when I was in college and dreaming about being at MIT 
¡Gracias por subir este tipo de contenido!

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
36:50 It is not p and lp, it is p(polynomial) and np(not polynomial). I think he misspoke about it.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do they keep laughing whenever the professor shows the intersection planes?

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
After a couple of years away from these topics I felt in love again with them. You gave me the light to find them again. Thanks! (there are not enough words to explain you all my gratitude about this) :-), best wishes.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's what makes MIT ... MIT

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
A lot of respect for Professor Gilbert Strang, even at the age of 86, he is still teaching the world and sharing knowledge for free to many students in the world.
I recently started taking Linear Algebra course to understand some topics because I was struggling with the theory for PCA taught in MIT 18.6501x and in 6.419x. And finally I was able to understand some of the topics. I hope to learn linear algebra this year, and start this course in 2022.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
*applause* That was great.

I remember those rules as
"First d-second plus second d-first"
"Low d-high minus high d-low, all over low-squared"
"d-inside times d-outside."

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Thank you for an excellent lecture! Give me a clear track for development.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This professor is also a interesting programmer🤓

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I went to a community college and my instructors were at least as good as any of the instructors I've seen on this channel. Specifically my physics instructor, Dr. Lecuyer, my math instructors Dr. Madson and Mr. Young.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Did he say
 toin coss??

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
At 11:35, I can't believe that he made such an obvious mistake! Everybody knows that the correct end of the formula is I+U=<3 :-D

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I would love to have this man as my teacher.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] In fact he is French, his name is Denis Auroux.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At the integral at 30:39 does x depend on "y" or "z"? Or maybe both?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This we call applied mathematics. I honestly think the only great thing about MIT is a few gifted students every year and the fact that they prob got a lotta resources compared to other universities around the world

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That is logically impossible because i never came from papa New Guinea

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Do we ever use cofactors for anything else besides computing the determinants?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Great.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Great video great lecture great professor.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
there are a number of fool students they don't deserves this much intelligent people around i believe from India

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
have you watched the entire series? after you're through with the entire course, let us know if you feel like MIT students aren't learning calculus as thoroughly as you are...

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Its very interesting to see the interviewer who genuinely look up to the person who she is interviewing

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
that totally made sense...

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
In 32.08, can anyone explain how does he derive v(t) and u(t)?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
tnx for sharing this

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:40 "We are executing a determinate formula here." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
How could "any element of S+any element of U"= "all 3*3's"?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
is anyone student of him? ^^

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wonderful! 

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
In the section Row space orthogonal to null space, (time 25.40) do we need transpose for row. Because (row)*x is the scalar product, not (row)^T*x.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
00:00 - 10:14
component of vector along a direction

10:15 - 24:25
Area of 2D pentagon, determinant of two vectors in 2D space

24:26 - 32:45
3D space: volume

32:46 - 47:06
cross product
3D space: area

47:07 
Volume without determinant

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This seems to be the best discussion of line integrals (as noted below, starts around 16:00) of the many on YouTube because most straightforward.
.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Watchin' at 2x speed

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I thought this was an excellent lecture - lectures10 and 11 were a real struggle to get through but this really cleared up a lot of the terminology and why the four  fundamental subspaces are so important. Thumbs up Professor Strang.

(Weird ironing creases on his blue shirt in the vicinity of his right nipple.)

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Jump to 10:00, that is where the fun begins.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video Exponential and log From Your

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
It is amazing how he can do these lectures in front of no students and still be so engaging. In a way he is a great actor.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
44:25 Isn't vectors right hand side weird? I think it must be V^T*W = W1*V1^(T)+... so it becomes Dot product

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
At 17:30, he says we have four equations with three unknowns. How does a logic Ax = b may not have a solution flow from that? For three variables, three equations are enough. A fourth equation would appear dependent, or make a solution impossible. Is that the point? While b could have been any thing had there been four variables, but constrained when there are only three variables.
Edited: I get it. b can not be any thing arbitrary. Unless it is in the column space of A, there can be no solution.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the boards and the chalks so much that I can fly there and solve a tangent line problem on those boards with those lovely chalks. What a chalk to write with, and what a board to write on.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Eigenvalue lam=1.0 leads to a term exp(lam t) = exp(t) grows out of bound. Or am I missing the point. In the last lecture lam= 0 became the steady state value.

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Denis Auroux is the epitome of cool.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
I think he is a chinese teacher

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
My algebra teacher uses his book to teach, while I learn from the author himself. 😂 Upgrades.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where can I find such practice sets which contains many many such problems?

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Excellent teaching styles.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
I think cancelling S at 38:05 is a mistake. Variance must decrease by increasing the number of samples!

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
What a wonderful proof

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
0:00 ~ vector subspace
11:38 ~ column space
28:12~ null space

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
“Handy to have a pair of scissors with you” 28:10

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:34 - if these formulae are explained graphically it would be much easier to understand and interesting.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Image compression may be applied in Maclintock's  cytogenetic jump over   chromosones  over by a screwing the chromosomes for every one degree producing super conductivity involving the solar light pressure acting on chrosomes  jump  over by the crygenetic effect as observed from matrics application in topology .
Sankatavelayudhan Nandakumar on behalf of Hubble Telescope Researrch commitee thanking Prof.Sprang .

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man I love chalkboards n the sound the make :D

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]hehe that's true, 

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
donde consigo informacion de universidades con clases en idioma español

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
Cool.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Can anyone explain me last graph 📈 thing

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
42:40 Hahah are complex numbers that bad? As a passerby (who still watched the whole thing) imaginary numbers don’t seem to bad, neither do eigenvalues/vectors but i’ll admit i can’t answer any example questions yet so maybe i’m just too confident for my own good lol

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Professor mentioned a book named 'Mathematics for the Million' which he had read in childhood
However, the book is written by  'Lancelot Hogben', not by the guy named 'Bell'. =D
(If you are interested, check 'THE ALGEBRA OF THE CHESSBOARD' chapter of book https://archive.org/details/HogbenMathematicsForTheMillion/page/n527/mode/2up )

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]your teacher probably didn't know the actuall proof or derivation herself.  HS teachers are often dumb anyway

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:30 logarithmic differentiation

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Really love Professor Strang. By the way, does this course take MIT18.06 as a prerequisite?

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks to the camera guy

### 3. Parametric Inference
Cheap charity. Dirty black boards, illegible writings. Video art of some amateur. Is MIT to poor to fund a good online course in statistics?

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am prepping for Mathematical Methods at Udub by watching these amazing lectures,

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Wow.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
28:37 that was awkward. Looks like he actually left the class, poor guy.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lecture 3
Vector addition ➕ properties of vector https://youtu.be/LX88tL7EoBs

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
At 41:39 i think he meant A2 times conditional probability of B given A2 happened, right ? must be a slip of tongue

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
professor you have my deepest thanks for these wonderful lectures. you will always be remembered by your lovely lectures

### 34. Final Course Review
Excellent! Thank you Professor Strang.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Oooo man very very good thanks professor😎♥

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
God bless you. That is what education should be like. Available to everyone!!!

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:50

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watched this 5 months ago but needed refresher as I've got sidetracked in my learning! It's very nice to be walked through the least-squares equations. The explanations are easy to understand. Thanks Prof Auroux and MIT.

### 13. Bernoulli Process
nice video

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor Jerison is the goat

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Great... Its just a great lecture... :)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Good professor, nice explanation, but I don't see that much a difference with my professor here in Greece, he explains the matrices just as well. The odd part is my professor linked us to this video to understand matrices better, but to be honest he could as well linked us to his own video :)


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is in a need of a lesson on teaching really.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Its kind of cool and odd that someone who has taught this subject for so long can keep it so fresh...like he's stumbling across the Null Space Matrix for the first time.  Thank you Dr. Strang and thank you MITOCW.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Thank you Professor Strang ! 

but I think 14:43 is in the nullspace of (A-I)^T rather than nullspace of A^T isn"t it ?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Thumbs up to the camera angle management team; great video audio editing.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:14: Okay let's take a vote, is it sin-sin or sin-cosine? Proof by popularity!

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow he sure knows a great deal of physics!

### 12. Iterated Expectations
32:40 How do we write the expectation value as 1/2 and 3/2 ?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
OK

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good explanation but the convention for letters assigned to angles (phi, theta) is different to the more usual one . Theta,  usually is  used for the angle from z-axis

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
47:40 Turing starts

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
its incredible what 15 years does 🙌🏽

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Dear Mr Strang sounds so much similar to Tom Hanks. You have to listen with your eyes closed to notice.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He brought the actual chain!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Those chalkboards blow my mind

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At around 26:50, why does the professor not mention anything about the case where the discriminant is zero and there is only one root?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
That's what I thought, and then I failed calculus1. I dind't make the same mistake again. Math and calculus, always evolve in a very streamlined fashion from the previous subject. That's why they make sure you DO know what a derivative/limit etc. is. I studyed IT in hs and saw allot of the same stuff in college too, by the end I had such a deep comprehension of IT I realized why you start with most of the basics again. You can learn how, but knowing why, that's the true knowledge.

such a good teacher

### 15. Poisson Process II
The bus inter-arrival time example is a bad/counteractive example. If buses are running at the rate of 4 per hour, You go at a random time for many days and your average waiting time should be  7.5 minutes. Why would the bus company foll people by saying we are running buses whose time is determined by poisson process and not a uniform/predetermined time?

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
in the diffusion equation, if u=u(x,y,z,t), why when taking the gradient we only take the partial derivatives of x,y,z? (for F in the left hand equation min. 49:10). I suppose it's because they're spatial dimensions, but then you need more constraints to make the result in the right hand of eq. not depend on time.. Thanks.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
28:43 I'm kinda confused, why we are getting zero vector here, shouldn't it be vector 3, -1  https://matrixcalc.org/en/#%7B%7B1,2%7D,%7B3,6%7D%7D%2A%7B%7B3%7D,%7B-1%7D%7D

### 12. Iterated Expectations
wow I watched many different sources , this is by far the best and most clearly explained video. It really help us that love mathematics and want to learn by ourselves.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
About 2 years ago, I failed a college linear algebra exam, and not only that, but I got the lowest in the class by a whopping 2 standard deviations (if I remember correctly). Eventually I dropped the course--I was so bored and discouraged by the professor's way of writing the textbook on the board every lecture that I looked for other sources to prepare for when I would have to take it again. I came across Prof. Strang preaching the 4 fundamental subspaces one day at my custodial job at 5 am. To say that it completely changed everything is a bit of an understatement. Every day, I would rush to work (again, keep in mind this is at 5am!), beast through all my work in about 2 hours, and then watch Prof. Strang teach for another 2 while avoiding my supervisor! It was a full-on addiction to a subject I once hated (: I can't even begin to describe how much better my college experience has been because of this man. (:

Best professor ever. It would be an honor to meet him (:

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you! This is so helpful, currently studying calculus I at the Australian National University and this is a very useful supplement :)

### 3. Independence
super nice lecture

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you for great linear algebra course.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
GS: "the determinant of an upper triangular matrix would be just (d1) times (d2) times ...*hands rotate* (dn)."
me: *writes (dnd)*

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Traditional camera angles were WAY easier on the eye.

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great teacher. His remarks were very helpful in clarifying some of the fundamental questions that were quite mirky. Thank you professor, thanks MIT!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I just clicked on this to feel how dumb I really am

### 4. Counting
This is so fun !! I love math I take precal and I'm in 10 grade

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you Dr. am from kenya, university of nairobi doing econ, this is very helpful

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 27:34, the professor squared the equation both sides, is this OK to decide the trajectory of the equation? E.g., x = y is a line, but x^2 = y^2 is two lines, they are different.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
7:45 how is edge 1, 2 and 3 make a loop when loop 3 is pointing to the opposite direction to the flow of edge 1 and 2 ??

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
My only problem with the MIT lectures is they spend to much time on theory, rather than working problems. Although I'm sure they do problems during the recitation.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
why u(0)= [1,0].T, is it a dummy vector that help calcuate?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think there was a bit of misunderstanding with the question a student asked around 17:30. The student asks why the right hand limit must exist. When the instructor wrote down "right hand limit" he didn't mean the limit from the right hand side (x->a+), he literally mean the limit he wrote on the right.

Technically, the right hand limit (x->a+) has to exist otherwise the full limit wouldn't exist, but that goes without saying.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I love this lecture so much. Thank you a lot prof.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yeah he's french

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is an amazing lecture for Linear Algebra. Thank you Prof. Strang!

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Im from a Machine Learning background(masters at the moment) and you are really good and smoothly going from concept to concept, in my opinion. I hope to continue this series during the holiday season.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
You are the best maths professor i've come accross thankyou so much Dr Gilbert Strang you're a blessing for all the students who struggle with linear algebra

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Who was the person that entered the room; and we always Prof. portraying his sense of humour, "Whether the rest of the world realize that I was in danger!!" Such a great mathematician with such great sense of humour!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Great teacher. Wish my instructor could explain the concepts like he does. Wasted some time wondering why we were doing those problems. The concepts are so important.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]How is this an unknowledgeable class? Everybody raised their hands when asked, if you watched the video. You don't have to take physics to take calculus classes, and a teacher cannot skip vector introduction because he feels like it. How is it that you assert that there is a lack of trigonometry knowledge here? Prerequisite calculus, and basic high school classes such as algebra and trig, were skipped by all of these students then? Simply trolling, let's be honest. A YouTube math

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
that fourth way is absolutely beautiful 🎂

### 3. Independence
This prof has a way of making the ideas make sense. I am grateful, because I always dread learning about anything related to stats.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Most math courses will tell you the mechanisms by which to calculate problems.
But what I always wish they would begin with is a little history and purpose. For example what was the original, real world problem that linear algebra was created to solve? Yes, it solves systems of linear equations, but in the real world, how am I going to get a system of linear equations? How will I recognize where to apply this?

All through college I've never had a class that started that way and so math was just about memorizing the mechanisms to solve the test problems. Why? I'm not a teacher but if I were I would try to teach it differently.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
@[USERNAME]he says we are 1/sqrt(n) away from the mean. How does the CLT say that? The CLT says sqrt(n)(theta-thetahat) converges in distribution to N(0,sigma^2), what part of that statement gives an indication that the distance of the estimated mean to true mean is approximately the inverse of the square root of the sample size? It looks like it says the distance is proportional to the square root of the sample size, not the inverse of the square root of the sample size.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Well, i don't want to look like an assuming but i can't conceive math of any kind without demonstrations. And i see none in this video, i just see notions that seem to be confirmed by numeric examples. The risk is to give for granted lots of things. In the example of P U L he clearly said that it's never a vector subspace, that's not correct if you don't say that if L lays on P. P U L is a subspace too. So he should have said that P is a plane containing O , L is a line containing O but not on the plane P, in this Hyp then PUL is not a subspace, otherwise i't a subspace being equal to the plane P

this guys has a point. it's part of being educated, having seen important concepts. He didnt even say "without having *memorized..*" he said *seen.
it's not a matter of perfect SAT scores either– why bring that up?

well done

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yup.I agree.Lack of humor and lengthy and boring lecture.[Not all of them].I don't understand why they make it so complicated by elaborating a lot of simple concepts.Is it because they want to preserve MIT standards?

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think there was a slight mistake in 24:40 where it's is stated that there is an inflection point at x iff f''(x) = 0. But this (as far as I know) is not true. Because what I know about inflection point is that f changes from concave up to down at that point, which means the second derivate must change sign. But in some cases f''(x) = 0 but nothing changes in concavity at x. (like y = x)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I have been trying hard to grasp on the concept of matrices and anywhere I started teachers would burden me with tons of formulas I do not know when or where to use, and then they say you practice some questions and you would get "marks" that resulting into I kept on failing math exams. Now when I understand this my teacher himself sits besides me to understand how I solve my questions and sometimes say I never taught you this. I can never thank you enough sir.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is the best lecture for Linear Algebra.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
What is understanding the concepts he's presenting in comparison to being able to explain them to someone else? It's not nothing, to use a double negative, but you get the idea. It's of course not the only difference between professors and students, but if you can find someone interested enough, try explaining it to them, and you'll never forget the lesson. If you're not a professor, one difficult task is finding someone who's interested, in order to practice. Normally, the way to do this on your own is to write proofs.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I did not understand how did we related the formula ( TAYLOR ) that is produced from a spesific type of function ( POLYNOMIAL )  to other types of functions such as trigonometric and exponantial. In other words how can we apply taylors formula to all types of functions, eventhough it is proven by polynomials ( at least in this video).

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I had to take a stats class as a requirement for my Admin Justice major..after I took this class and achieved in it just by sheer trying hard and studying..I was able to get an A and decided to try science and engineering courses and I did pretty good because I got Fs in HS when I took them. So I thought I'd settle for a career with less education requirement after HS--20 years later I'm a software engineer for a major telahealth company. I'd never would expect this--I thought I'd be a cop

34:30 You might want to search YouTube for time invariant diffusion. The diffusion equation can be simplified by noticing that it looks the same if time goes forward as when time goes backward and a situation like that you can reverse the dye dillution. There are fantastic videos about how it's done. Do not say that partial differential equations are boring.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was so nervous about taking multivariable calculus at my college, because I was failing to understand the vector calculus I was learning at the end of calculus 2. I now realize it's not really that hard because I understand it, and that math minor is mine!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of the best calculus lectures!

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why can't dx/dy be squared to become dx^2/dy^2 ? After all, dx/dy can be treated as two separate number when solving a separable differential equation. Aren't dx and dy just two very small number that shrink to as low as you want, so that they present no significant value - have so many zero's in them after the decimal point-  that each of them is near enough to zero to ignore, but their ratio remains the same so that the slope can be found.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces

After watching this lecture, all I can say is how truly amazed I am. What a great video! Except for the fact that I couldn't understand one word he was saying( currently taking Tech Math at HS). I mean the camera was on point, his writing was nice, and the students were quite polite. Superb! MIT you surely do not disappoint :D

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Thank you sir.

### 34. Final Course Review
By the way, youtube is for some reason changing the "less than" sign into "<". Following up on my last comment (this feels like "linear algebra 500 characters at a time!"), if the solution is not unique there are either no solutions or infinitely many. Since we know that b=[1, 0, 0] has no solution in Ax=b, it must mean it's the former case. To answer this question means reversing the reasoning here. Starting with the fact that b has no solution and deducing from there that r is less than m.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
This is the moment in time where I have to say thank you! In my opinion this lecture connects everything that happend until now beautifully and builds the foundation for solving most advanced engineering problems.

@[USERNAME]But the professor is French! LOL

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Beautiful lecture

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I'm quite surprised at the silence of the class during lecture when he asks them pretty simple questions. Are these MIT undergrads just so ultra shy and polite that they refuse to speak at all during lecture, or are they really just not following what he's saying?

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For any other class, following around the teacher would be fine, but not for Calculus or any other type of math!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Awesome!!

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
I am freestyle developer in Brazil and since started my career did never have contact with computer science academics lectures, but after some years of experience I am loving all the free lectures MIT is providing in youtube. I have watched almost the whole channel since then, and I loved this one too.  I would love now to set up a  goal to study in MIT personally, but don't even know how much is the financial and general requirements to get into CS grad program.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If angle is measured in radians then the formula for arc length=theta*radius, as radius=1, arc length=theta, Now as angle theta gets closer to 0, arc length and that straight line, i.e. sin(theta), sits on top of each other making sin(theta) = arc length, so that is why sin(theta)/theta=1, as value of both sin(theta) & theta becomes equal.  and NOW as those two quantities are equal, it makes cos(theta)= radius= 1. and when calculated (1-cos(theta)/theta)=(1-1/theta)=(0/theta). and 0/anything=0. Correct me if I m wrong.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I read it in the comments of another one of these videos. I don't remember the exact comment though.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand how the student in the audience thought that the u and v the professor drew looked similar.

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree. Then again, most high schools don't have layers of cascading chalk boards...

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Toughest lesson so far

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
According to the mit prerequisites, all that is necessary for this course is high school algebra and trigonometry. To answer your question, yes, it is the right way to begin

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Long may Professor strang live!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have a question in 22:00 if x0 go to infinitive then the value would be bigger and bigger isn’t it? for example -1/1 < -1/1000

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
who's still here in 2020 XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He makes things too complicated where they are not.The proof of the magic number M(a) was in my high school text book in a formal way.He mixed up the things.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Boy, there are some dumb students in MIT. These are really basic stuff.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like calculus

Great lecture from one of the grandmasters...indeed a true honor to hear this

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Honey you should see him in a crown

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Thank you MIT for share this valuable lecture

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thanks for this!

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
awesome! Thank you very much. :)

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
When teaching is this solid, learning feels effortless and pleasant. Like eating good food one bite at a time. =P

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at    31:00  how  come  that  a  vector  u  in  any  direction  in the surface   graph  of  restriction   g= c  implies  that   df/ ds in  u  direction   is  zero ?  .....It  is  another  surface   !    ...the  graph  of   f   ....NOT   of  g.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
independence: a bunch of vectors are independent if there is no such combination among them that gives zero (other than all-zero combination).
reminder: pivots represent independent columns while free columns mean there is dependence.
a bunch of vectors C in a matrix A are independent when the nullspace of Ac =0 happens only when C is all zeros, a matrix of independent columns will have a rank = n (number of columns).
span: vectors v1...vl span a space when that space consists of combinations of those vectors.
basis of a space is a sequence of vectors v1...vd that are 1. independent 2. span that space
basis test:
n vectors of subspace Rn give basis if the matrix made from those vectors is invertible.
given a space (such as Rn) then every basis for that space has same number of vectors (n vectors), that is what we call "Dimension".
so for a space(n) we have a matrix A where rank(A) =  no. of pivot columns = dimension of space n

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I want to adopt him as my grandpa.

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
this guy is my theta^ for the distribution of cool statisticians

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
But adding an identity matrix plus upper triangular gives us again upper triangular so in this special case we obviously dont get  all 3×3 matrices or 9 dimensions? Or am i missing smthing?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I had to rewind at 38:23... did I hear a flatulence?

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
32:28 I think he missed...

Nearly all Newtonian mechanics uses vectors.

### Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums
Great 💔 i am from Bangladesh

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
a wonderful human being and a legend! thank you Professor Strang.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Nice lecture. Easy to see why solutions are exponential in t. But, I did not get why solution is exponential in lambda*t.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]obviously no professor at MIT lacks knowledge, but it looks like he's not "in" the whole lecture. he's just on another level than the students. Being a good teacher, one needs to be on the same level as the students. Btw i'm doing masters in mathematics so don't think im an inexperienced student

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
why am i watching this before board exams??...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I learned this in 8th grade wtf??

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
i love these lectures... but this episode has LITERALLY the worst cameraman ever...

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
in conditional PMF, what if the probability of each random variable is not same? Then how do we scale each probability?

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you. I've just learned that a few days ago, and you helped me to understand it better.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Very helpful, thanks! ✌️

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
WTH,

first 2 min in. Kilowatt hour is NOT the same type of unit as calorie or ft-lbs. KwH is energy per unit time whereas the other 2 are just energy.

and why is he using those horrendous English units. Use the damn metric system.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Awesomely done prof. XD.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Is there a technology at MIT to effectively remove chalk from the chalkboard?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
at 26:52 why does he use a^t vs regular a

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
The silence in the class is profound!

### 34. Final Course Review
thank you prof Strang..... i'm really appreciate your series of lectures and its make me want to study more advance maths........... i really thank you soo much...

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
DID HE JUST DIS MR. SCHMIDT👀😂😂

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pa mi huevo jsjsjjss

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the prof. used too complicated of an example in this lecture, the students seemed confused and I had a hard time following it ... he went in 1,000 different directions

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally a professor who gets straight to the material.  No wasting half a lecture on philosophical gasbagging.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Disculpe no fue mi intención incomodar con mi comentario, al contrario estoy muy agradecido con los cursos. Bueno muchas gracias y espero que sigan colocando más videos. Saludos cordiales.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
whoooo!!, just lost in the wild. I have to watch it again.

i don't care, they still charge so much money they can offer these without asking for donations

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You can axpromiate almost every function under certain condition with a polynomial given by the Taylor rule, that's why :)

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks MIT and this professor is really great.
Thanks professor really appreciate your teaching

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Beautiful lecture and amazing lecturer !!!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I had never seen that "stack the 2nd matrix on top" visual aid for multiplication - very helpful visualization

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Im sorry but i think this is a very poor lecture compared to the others

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I HATE MATH

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
How strange is it that the student pointed out the exact mistake the concept of which the professor was gonna go ahead with. i.e the connection bw column space and row space.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome lecture, thanks!

7:00

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
looks like the best school needs some smart boards, or even white boards, lol

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Let me guess. This was the first video you ever watched in the realm of machine learning. Now you're an engineer.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thanks (2 years after) because I didn't understand it. Now it's obvious :D ! 


### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Professor Alan Edelman, thank you for a beautiful lecture and a power introduction to Julia. I watched and take notes from all 36 lectures and they are awesome. I learned  a tremendous amount of Linear Algebra from the Grandfather of all mathematics. Thanks to MIT and all the wonderful people behind the scenes for putting these lectures together.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Glad to see these lectures. It would have been an honour being taught by this professor! A lot of things are making sense today, that didnt make sense when I took college a decade ago.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Its because people are in the middle of viewing the videos

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Someone please give a medal to Prof. Auroux. Genius indeed how he closed the lecture with Divergence...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really awesome!👏🏽

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what clean boards!!!, love them :)

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
His accent makes this very hard to listen to at 2x speed...

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
amazing

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
calculus is pointless. 

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
"for like 48 different reasons, that determinant is zero. It's dead" OMG I love this guy

ich versteh es nich  Mein kopf macht BOOM!

### 3. Independence
Legendary..!

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where can I find lec8?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The guy is million times more enthusiastic than my 26 yr old maths teacher... Hats off

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I have been waiting for this since the day I was born ! I shall achieve the Buddhahood once OCW releases the "Functional analysis" series.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
1:39 <--- and there you go. This statement pretty much sums up EVERY video on YouTube that has to do with EigenSTUFF conceptually. Yes, clearly...there is SO much more, but if for someone learning this the first time, this is such a critical outcome that NO textbook that I read, other than his, clearly and succinctly states this simple cue. Even after getting degrees in math and physics, it took me a bit of time to figure this out eventually. Thank you, MIT, for sharing this.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Prof. Edelman, Are you saying that generic programming and support for types and operators (+,-,/,* etc.) results in these benefits? Or are there other language features in Julia that make this possible? Thank you for making the lecture available to the world.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought that students that get into MIT take at LEAST 1 calculus course in high school. Apparently not. Or they could be refreshing. I'm not sure.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Very good video

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
buenas dias

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For anyone who is confusing why u[t] = exp(At)* u[0] is showed up here, a video made by @3Blue1Brown really explains it well:
Title: 'How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6'
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6&index=7&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
Hope this could help you out~

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
great man!!!!

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
At around 8:57, professor says that only zero vector leads to zero in the inequality, which is wrong. Because as long as x is in the nullspace of A, the equal sign will be reached in the inequality

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Love for Prof Strang .😊. Real picture of Eigen value and eigen Vector ..AX parallel to X ...touched and fascinated  with real story behind Mathematics. Lucky students  of MIT who is quietly listening  the story interestingly.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]fuuuuck, I made the same mistake the person at 37:50 did XD

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Fantastic artwork.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
God I don't know if I am crazy, but when he goes around with a demonstration which takes hours and he pases over a figure such as saying :"the slope of a exp to x where x=0 and we know that a exp 0 is equal to 1. right there what could it be easier.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
40:00 wait, doesn't the slope also approach zero as x approaches infinity?

### 16. Markov Chains I
Very clear

### Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem
Great Lecture!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
They could have mics for students to go up to when asking questions. I kind actually want to hear their questions

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I wish i was a student sitting over there and attending the class....

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah he is right , of course, sorry teacher.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
MIT has 100s of millions of dollars in its Trust .... can't nail down quality audio pick-up ....  money ain't everything ....

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
Can anyone be awesome enough to explain how he gets (2/d) * (2/pi) as the density of X and theta respectively? He is saying it has to integrate to 1 which I kind of understand as the PDF but not sure how he gets there... @25:07

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Take another look at the list...the first time I feel glad at so many left unwatched.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Camera: I see you're leraning about Morkov Matric- (3:43)
Heyy nich shirt ma dude

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I think this subject is pretty easy and there's not much of rules to follow by, but he took so much time to explain!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Such a shame education system in my country is as archaic as The Flintstones, although they have a better education than we do here, and well, what can we expect, Spanish invaders brought thieves, scum and crap to our continent.

Long live America.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
32:44 I guessed 7 too 🤗 thank you auntie

### 14. Poisson Process I
hahaha, this guy does not get ready for lectures hahah. so funny..

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Generally people from India, specially Bihar think that they are very smart in mathematics but that's of type "Rattafication" a/c my experience
Here's the actual mathematics !!!
Literally Loved this lecture, wish to complete whole calculus part from here, not for any entrance but just to make my understanding to next level!
Thanks MIT :)

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
45:34 the other revolting stuff. 


oh, my motherfricking god. this guy is a genius.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
wonderful professor

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This instructor makes the subject over-complicated by burying the student in unnecessary details. The solution of the 2X2 example can be found in 3 to 5 minutes. The 3X3 example will take a little longer, but maybe the instructor needs to dazzle the students to justify making the class longer.
Take the first equation:                                     2x    - y = 0
Add the second equation multiplied by 2:    -2x + 4y = 6
Add them together:                                            0x + 3y = 6  dividing by 3, we get y = 2.
Inserting the value of y into the first equation:  2x  -2 = 0  and add 2 to both sides we get:  2x = 2
                                                                                                                                                            or  x = 1
For the second equation:                                    -x + 2y = 3, so:   -x + 2(2) = 3  or   -x + 4 = 3  
 Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:                                                                      -x = -4 + 3  or -x = -1
So,                                                                                                                                      x = 1
Final solution:  y = 2, x = 1.  DONE.
Graphing left to the student.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:22 creativity at its best

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
este profesor no sabe explicar se traba mucho

### 11. Recursion Theorem and Logic
1:14:50 i have been thinking about this question for days which is related to pset2 #4 [projection of decidable iff T-recognizable].How can we be sure that proofs itself doesn't cause looping.In the sense of projection problem How can i be sure that recognizable T is trying new inputs and not wasting its time with a pointless circles in specific pair of (x,y)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watching this to make me feel better about college algebra. lol

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
When he plots the solutions x in R^4 at minute 23-24, he plots Xp, Xn and Xcomplete=X. Shouldn't Xn be drawn through the origin and Xcomplete be drawn away from the origin and at the 'plane' without going through the origin?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone kindly compute y-intercept for me? Where x = 0 into the asterisk eqn. I would just like to prove that y = 2y0. Thanks!

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Too bad I can't afford all his books 😩... I'll start with his linear algebra books 🧐

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you, Strang! It was _you_ who inspired me to pursue mathematics years ago! (I owe you a lot for that gift.)

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Perfect professor and perfect explanation, how strange

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Anyone in 2018?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Keep up the good work🙏

### Lecture 12: Lebesgue Integrable Functions, the Lebesgue Integral and the Dominated Convergence...
Respectable professor Dr. Casey your each lecture is brain storming

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
The problem of that calculation is given eigenvalues, the choice of orthonormal eigenvector matrix is not unique (we can multiply -1!). If we choose U not as identical, but as [[1,0],[0,-1]], the calculation will be alright.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Why is it that if there are more unknowns than there are equations there exists a whole bunch of solutions?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Here i thought  this was a Linear Algebra course . And was I surprised>>>>????

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Dr. Strang thank for helping me to relearn linear algebra and it's important concepts. When I took this class at the University of Maryland Baltimore County the professor did not care if I learn it or not.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of the best teachers that I've ever seen. I'm from Brazil and I could﻿ understand all their classes. Congratulations to the teacher and the institute (MIT). A very good job.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Where can I solve problem related to this lecture

### 15. Regression (cont.)
Thank you for the lectures, could you please state what topics did Lectures 10 and 16 covered? So we can research them 
separately.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I am glad to see you again, Prof.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Y pensar que pocos son los que ven estos videos.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
x/lnx IS DEFINED at x=0.

ln(0+) approaches –infinite = -1/0
so if f(x) = x/(lnx)
f(0) = 0/(ln0) = x/(-1/0) = x*(-0/1) = 0
Despite popular belief here in the comments, x=0 need not be an open dot, but closed as displayed.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
let's take a little shot at thinking 9 dimensions lol

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

But lessons are great!!!! I'am enjoying from every class. Thank you Gilbert Strang

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
Glad Philippe touched on the John Oliver p-hacking haha

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
For the QR decomposition ( 47:00 )  you can use Q^t * Q = I. With this you get:
                         R = q1^t * a1 q1^t * a2
                                 q2^t * a1 q2^t * a2
but since we work in real numbers the internal product
                                 A^t. B = B^t. A
Using it, we are left with:
                        R =  a1^t * q1 a2^t * q1
                                 a1^t * q2 a2^t * q2

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
もし、本当に一橋大学を不正に落とされてたら一流大学に行きますが嘘情報なら今の大学に残ります。当然だろう。不正な方法で大学に入れる訳ないだろう。

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Gilbert, you are an extremely good lecturer plus a very pleasant person.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
i hate these types of professors that gives the most simplest examples then expect us to do the most complex problems like this guy

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just the exam and then 18.01 is done. Thank you MIT.
😊🇮🇳. 
INDIA.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What was so funny about the plane intersection?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Only one example and prof strang  can explain work done by centuries

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
may I ask what the p mean?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
the best, thanks!


### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
21:45, 29:10 - how to know whether f'(c) is PARALLEL to line 'a➡b'?
Exciting to listen to the real life problem solving examples and techniques.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very beneficial lectures. Thanks MIT  from 2020's (:

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
15 years later still the best

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Sir Gilbert Stang is my inspiration for learning linear algebra

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at what age do mit students study..... if anyone knows pls tell me

### 12. Time Complexity
where is the lecture 13?

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
in 30.41 he writes "set u=Sv" he says that S is the eigenvector Matrix but he does not say nothing for WHAT IS THIS "v small" ,and why did he do that trick..it is disheartening

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha so easy

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
THATS ART

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Seems like a great instructor.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
YouTube: You're taught the same things as MIT students, but potentially twice as fast!

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
The students close the door so gently. Nice.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finish at 21 March 2020

### 15. Poisson Process II
well done!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I had a question and was hoping somebody could help me out here. The two spaces (floor and wall) were not orthogonal because not all vectors were orthogonal. In fact, they intersect in a line and hence have equal vectors. But in general two planes will always intersect in a line and in that case can never be orthogonal. So how can the row space of a 4x4 matrix of rank two be orthogonal to the null space of that matrix? I really can't find where my reasoning is off.

### 17. Markov Chains II
very helpful videos...

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
at 24.45 u explain cdf abt uniform continuous r.v the distribution goes linearly... what abt the case if it is non-uniform??

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i couldnt resist xD

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
whats the point for me to paying for my host uni.. I cant understand what they were saying and i have to come up to attend lecture from other uni


### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The subtitles said "Windowed financially bathroom" 31:13

What the hell? 

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can some one explain me what is the meaning of   'low and behold' .

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha, they freaked out when he mentioned Taylor approximation. I love Taylor appr. it makes life so much easier ;)

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Is there a playlist where all of these lectures on Linear Algebra of 18.06 can be accessed?
For every course taught by Professor Strang?

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really fucking bombed the exam, damn.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks! I prepared my high school final exam from this lecture. This really helped me!!

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Just one feedback from a student: It would be even better if the camera doesn't move too frequently following the lecturer. 
Thank you for all the camera works, just wanted to help make them even better. Thanks for great videos.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
This is absolutely incredible. The 'big formula' was thrown at us with absolutely no context and no mention of arithmetic with determinants; this cleared up so much for my university algebra course.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
This professor is awesome!

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This  dude  is excellent! 

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
but if we realy have to solve with cartesian co-ordinate what will we do?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's been over 10 years since I first learned this in high school. Now I think I finally understand the formula for the derivative after this guy lectured for 20 minutes.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I have no doubt this man is a linear algebra genius, but I have no idea what he is talking about.  His manner of speaking is not linear.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
Proving closures using NFAs feels like a cheat code

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there no interactive transcript on this one? I'm not seeing it...

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
there is a mistake ! area of square bottom equal 2(square of x) plus four(xy)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]lol totally hope you're not serious.....

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Seems teacher didn't do his homework. Seems his concepts were not very clear. Because the proofs of sinx/x and other one of cos can be done by other methods as well and they are very easy.  He did not explain well some statement left unexplained. MIT myth is busted. I guess he can't even solve problems of mathematics in Indian engineering college entrance exam i.e. JJE advanced.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why was M(e) equated to 1?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Every thing is fine but why does professor repeats the  same shirt , tie and the pants ?😂

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
France

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
All are going well in this course series. But Professor didn't cover Error Analysis very well.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks so much, Professor Strang!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The smelly dill pathogenetically list because decimal acutely warm onto a waggish windshield. alive, husky angle

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
36:05 to sleep in front of 300k people... a fucking legend

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this an intro to Calculus? I learned everything this guy is talking about my Freshman year of High School.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
2013 or 2014?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You probably can't get into MIT.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
lol. i like the way he says temperature. (hope i spelled it correctly)

he's awesome!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Ax=b,does not have solution,but how does
A'Ax'=A'b have a solution since 
when we multiply by A' ,we just take combinations of rows and create new rows 
So ,if x' satisfies 2nd eqn , it must satisfy 1st 
pls clear my doubt  


### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Professor is gift to the mankind. Thank you so much.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Thank you heard my request

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]So you have a first calculus course and it doesn't include the basics of calculus? Sound strange.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very very nice.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's a university (or college) like any other. They teach lesser mathematics too, this is also the first lecture which is very typically a review of the previous course work or a very basic overview of what it will cover. I'm pretty sure they will go very in depth into these topics. 

After watching a bit more, its very obviously a first year class, which are not very difficult, especially the first lecture. Try watching lectures from the end of the semester from this class.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
didn't know multiplication could be this interesting

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
long live gilbert strang

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
after years and years of no well known university uploads a full course in this topic, it had to be MIT 

Thanks Again MIT from Bolivia!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
beautiful, beautiful stuff

### Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences
upload courses taught on computer screen in a infographic way

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
SO fantastic！！！THE Right way to open Linear Algebra!!! 我是来自中国的学生，当我认真学习线性代数的第一堂课后，我被深深的shocked到了！让我重新理解了维度！ N-D space is a combination of N-1-D sapce and non-N-1-D vector!

### 25. Classical Inference III
finished ....

### 23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
why do you just put the whole slide on the screen when he is pointing something on the slides? there is no way to see where he is pointing. just point the camera at the slide

### 9. Reducibility
21:36

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
That was a beautiful ending. It made me cry

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Thank you, Professor Strang.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I love this Man.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Great lectures! I just wanted to comment because I am learning a lot from all his lectures! And I already have a degree in physics!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I literally screamed why is this prof. so **** smart..


### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Lecture timeline Links
Lecture 0:00
What are Vector spaces 1:05
Subspaces of R³ 2:33
Is the union of two subspaces a Subspace? 4:23
Column space 11:36
Features a Column space 14:46
How much smaller is the Column space? 15:48
Does every Ax=B have a solution for every B? 16:17
Which Bs allow the system of equations solved 19:39
Null space 28:12
Understand what's the point of a Vector space 40:24

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Is there a link where I can find some exercises to practice the concepts of the lectures?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
We lived so long and we skipped the proof  39:40!!!!!!!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
That intro track tho

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
This is fantastic, very clear explanations. I'm currently taking Calculus 3 in Summer session and  I work a full time (40 hours per week)   so I have no life... well Calc 3 is my currently life. But I love it

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Such a great lecturer. Thank you!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
yeah but once you have supposedly found the y intercept the x intercept doesnt exist. fuckin idiot

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This was either: the class was taken just for the video and hence no students were there OR the students just didn't show up...if it was the latter it is really a great thing that Prof Strang did take the class at all, even for the video...if something like this had happened in my college then we would have been in so much trouble..

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
math is cool but i want that chalk

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
This man saved my GPA.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Great Teacher!

### 4. Counting
8:28 so n fuck-torial

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
my teacher multiplied times 10 = this teacher....

### 13. Regression
Great lecture, but what is stated at 58:15 is quite incorrect. Estimating demand from price alone can be quite tricky due to endogeneity issues. That is, from price alone you cannot know whether you are actually estimating a demand or supply function since the points can go in either direction.

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
1:09:19 the subtitle error "data" should be "theta". Same for the next sentence. Thanks

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
For the Complex Unit Circle part, watching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BcZjxKsVnY&ab_channel=Elucyda) prior helped me better understand it

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
woah this guy just singlehandedly saved this semester for me. and he does it so nonchalantly. i'm stunned

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you for the excellent lecture!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you so much, I have learnt a lot with the course, greetings from México.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
85 years old not a single white strand of hair in sight.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Woah!😍😍💝🇧🇩

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
"...giving other self-learners in the world opportunities of learning from the best."

True enough. Of course, it would also be nice if they would release a few more lecture series from other subjects. I'm spoiled now...  it is so frustrating walking into a course without already knowing it forward and back. 

;)

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Wow

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
In Spanish please 😞

### 18. Properties of Determinants
This is the most correct way to learn linear algebra.
Establish direct sense but not be buried by thousands of definition and proof.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Totally true.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Magistral lecture!

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what undergraduate year is this course?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Dr. Gilbert made these cofactor things are so obvious!

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
am i the only one watching the lectures in 1.5 or 1.25 playback speed?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Thank you MIT and Professor Strang for those fascinating lectures. In every lessons we reuse the things we have learned before and this makes a super connection between the topics. This lecture was a great example of that. Thank you again <3

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@ 11:30, the question given is not the same one given on the OCW site.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
@[USERNAME]

There are boards like that at my school.

Not that special of a device. Common at large universities.

Your videos have been saviour for me. Thanks a ton dear prof ❤️

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
감사합니다, Thank you.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
that's pleasure for me to see all of your videos and i can't stop to do it because i've learnt much things

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
wheres his blue shirt?


### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
Prof Strang, thank you so much for all your lectures.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
How did he get the equation x(s) = x(0) + as and similarly for y(s)??

### 3. Independence
Thank you, professor,
very intuitive, which is not have probability is usually taught but should be.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Selfeducation with such good teachers is the future! 
Thank you Professor Strang.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Thought there would be some Bj jokes 24:42 , but then again it's a MIT math class taught by Gilber Strang, maybe most are too absobed by his awsome lecture for that haha.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
So much love and respect for Prof. Strang! Thank you so much!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
So... I didn't even know what a matrix was until 80 minutes ago... 
This guy rocks!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
"Make Bases Orthonormal Again!"

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn’t delta x and delta f be dx and df since we’re talking the derivative.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
The greatest lecturer I've ever seen

### 15. Poisson Process II
Thank you!!! MIT!!!!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I can't stress my thanks enough. Thanks for everything Prof Strang, MIT.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what i dont understand is why teach such basic concepts again that were studied before and in depth in linear algebra?

Or take the law of cosinus: that is sth you'd need to know to get into almost any university. I mean you're attending multivariable calculus classes but you don't know how to sum two vectors?
Anyways, I'm not saying it's wrong, it's just a doubt that comes across when watching this video.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
at 33:40, why is it only true for union of finite number of sets?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
So HEEERE. As you can see. Something is appearing that we would note that way. Approximatively. These variables. We don't want these variables. OK. You drop it. What we want here it makes appear, on the plan, the derivatives of quantum mechanic (.)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
U.S. colleges offer a very wide variety of levels of mathematics.  Some majors require less math than others, and some students like to start college taking a certain level of math again as a refresher while they get used to college life.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Ι saw whales, SWAT, Ubuntu on the subs...

How come this lecture not have a correct subtitle like 1-8

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Gotta respect Gilbert Strang.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
the man the myth the legend Gilbert Strang

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does it matter whether english is my first language or not? If it was would you feel proud or ashamed? or if its not would you feel disgusted? Just back trace your statements a bit, You are asking why a student is in MIT because you feel the student asked a trivial question.. did you forget that it was a student? and that mistakes are expected from students?.. from MIT or NOT?  Or is your brain too slow to use that rational?  

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you， Professor Strang.

### 13. Bernoulli Process
38:38 I did not get what he meant. Y is a random variable indicating the time we have to wait. And for time, isn't it continuous? Then Y should also be a continuous RV. Why did he mention PMF rather than PDF?

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
This is way too advanced for me. I can understand the calculus but when he starts talking about convergence in probability and distribution, i get really lost. Can anyone point me to a book where i can get a better understanding on these topics of inference and convergence?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you for uploading it. I'm very appreciate it~~ I'm going back to university after graduated for 3 years. it help me refresh my knowledge a lot. 

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
The discrepency from canadian universities to MIT is an order of magnitude w.r.t to quality.   I am so thankful M.I.T did this.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
good professor, but no necessarily a clear one. respect him.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
there are three kinds of mathematicians 1) who know how to count 2) who don't.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
27:35

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Calculus<3

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This assumes the earth is flat.

Actually, since the earth is not flat and roughly spherical, if the blocks stack up to high enough scales, the blocks would need to cover the arc length of the circle (along which the blocks are run on the earth) and that arc length increases linearly with the radius from the center of the Earth;

hence I think the real answer would probably be no if you don't assume the earth is flat. (Just a thought)

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
good lecture

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Hi, I am just a beginner with not much knowledge.  Toward the End he is doing a proof stating that 
xTAT=(Ax)T.  I believe A is a square matrix and x is just a column vector.  To me this doesn't make sense.  I don't see how you can see can perform such an operation X Transpose A Transpose.  Can someone explain?

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Prof.Strang: "If you can tell me whats in that block , I'm gonna be quiet for the rest of the day" Wow !! 
 
This shows his passion. *Hats off* Sir ...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks.That's gonna be interesting. I was wondering how the concepts such as curl(F) can be extended to high-dimensional scenarios and also whether all the geometrical interpretations remain. 

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima

I really recommend this course! there are a lot of in-depth comments that refresh your understanding about statistic.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
then we basically have a bunch of rectangles. when n approaches infinity, the rectangles width gets infinity small, and the values for f(x) over that interval pretty much become equal, they differ very little. so we can multiple f(x) by the differential dx, the very small width, and get the anti derivtive of each one of the rectangles. the sum then becomes of a bunch of rectangles, and is now the following. [F(n)-F(n-1)] + [F(n-1) - F(n-2)] ...-[F(2) - F(1)]. THEN, the amazing part....

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
Thank you from the bottom of my Professor.
May Allah bless you.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the constraint made the system have only 2 degrees of freedom. Cause if Det=0 then the matrix is not Linearly Independent. Therefore: 
2x=λy, 2y=λx and xy=3 have only 2 L.I. equations. If Det=0.
This means if λ is a real unknown and x is an unknown, and y is an unknown, the equations is unsolvable if you only have 2 L.I. equations. 

3 unks with 2 L.I. equations, only becomes solvable when the constraint gave the system only 2 degrees of freedoms. Allowing you to solve for λ. This would also mean λ is not a real unknown.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
36:49 This paradox gave me a headache. In our school, we just solve dimensionless problems. This paradox opened my eyes to the subtlety of computations in calculus. Thank you, MIT.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I don't get how you get to decide a particular matrix which when multiplied by the original matrix results in a desired matrix.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Property 2 wasn't needed as a fundamental property, since it follows from property 3.

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i have studied scalars and vectors in intermediate educations but its just on the black board and i wz unable to implement it in real life.Honestly i was never comfortable with mathematics.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
His book is pretty terrible, but it's a bit more manageable with his lectures. I don't see where all the praise for him comes from, let's be honest he's an ok professor : 6.5/10

What a stunning illustration of pure applied logic. Lecturer truly pays tribute to the theory.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Look, your product rule argument is circular.  The proof of the product rule "assumes" two things:  1) That the limits exist.  2) that the functions are differentiable (at least around the limits).  Continuity can't be proven, if that is the assumption you are beginning with.

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Great lecture Dr. Tsitsiklis.   I have a question where you were applying divide and conquer to solve the Geometric example where A1: X=1 and A2: X>1.  You said that P(X>1) = (1-p).  But, this is the probability that the first toss is a T.  The case where the Head appears in the 5th toss for example also corresponds to P(X>1) and this probability is (1-p)^(4).q.  It seems to me that its the geometric sum of all the cases corresponding to X>1...  May be I am wrong in my thinking or just a little confused as to why you set P(X>1) to be the same as getting T in the first toss.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Colleges need to be removed, and all education will be online. We can visit labs for few month every year only for practicals. Current  education system is useless

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### 34. Final Course Review
thanks pro Strang, thanks MIT.  the best linear algebra course.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Expressing something really complicated in an easy and fun way is not about teaching or communication skills. It can only be achieved by an extremely deep understanding of the subject. Some might say their teachers teach badly because they don't have the passion or don't care about students. The surprising truth is that they actually don't have a deep enough understanding of those seemingly easy topics.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Why are we doing A transpose to fine the current? Any intuition?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Geometrically I can see why the intersection of two subspaces of Rn is another subspace, but thinking purely algebraically (in terms of sets) this does not seem obvious.

Does anyone have a clear way to explain in terms of intersections of sets of vectors why the result is a subspace?

In particular, it doesn't to me follow that any combination of vectors in S^T is necessarily still in S^T when thinking just in terms of sets of vectors.

I think intuitively (right - left) is due to the direction of the axis. Like top is always larger than bottom, the positive direction for the horizontal axis is set from left to the right, hence numbers on the right are larger. it might be an easier way to see this.

Dear Prof. Strang, you’re a great teacher

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Mmh I dont know, mathematicians can tell me what they want but I think their definition of infinity is fishy as hell! Using zero for both infinitely small as well as x=x' -->x-x'=0 seems irrational. Well I guess it's just a definition and phrase you have to get over... :X

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
OMG why did the -2 change into a minus -1 suddenly at 07:59

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I am a little bit confused so - why vectors (1,1,2) & (2,2,5) doesn't span the space R^3?? and why (1,1,2), (2,2,5) & (3,3,8) does span the space R^3?? 
I don't know why I am stuck here for days please if someone could explain a bit it would be a great help.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
These courses are the remedial courses of MIT, to get all students entering all fields up to some common level. Most students in america do this in a precalculus/trig course by 11th grade. The real MIT multivariable course for math/hard science majors is: 18.024

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
s is used to represent distance, rather confusingly, but v is used for velocity which clears that one up.

So, v = ds/dt.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
The way he says the days of the week is perfect. "Fridee"

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
other colleges should be envious that MIT has a great of a professor as Dr. Strang

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
maths practically awesome

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
He implied that while graphs are discrete, there is something analogous to a graph which is continuous. What is that something?

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
OMG I never knew that MLE has its theoretical basis. I always thought that it's based on common sense :-)

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
yeah! the golden ratio!

### 3. Independence
Wouldn't the fact that the king is actually a king lower the probability of the other sibling being a boy? Because if he were a boy and older, the current king would not be king, but his brother would be instead! Could someone please elucidate this?

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
30:55 Since the cofactor here is 0 coincidentally, it would be better to use a general tridiagonal matrix(n by n or at least 5 by 5) to show that the cofactor is Dn-2

### 34. Final Course Review
During these covid times, my lineare algebra teacher hasnt adapted to well to online courses, the material sucks. Started watching these half way through, only reason I passed the course. Online or offline, teachers should all take notes on Strang's method of teaching. In his words, THANKS.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Would have loved to have Professor Strang 40 years ago when I first experienced Linear Algebra in Pre-Algebra 1 and 2; 30 years ago in Finite Math with Calculus.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
42:15 why can't solutions form a vector space?? Why can't solutions form a subspace?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
The rule for the dimensions of Symmetric and Upper Triangulars only apply to 3x3 matrices?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Prof. Strang is a myth

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i learned this in 6th grade in my country lol

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
At 84 years of age, he continues to be a maverick in the world of math education. Inspiring, to say the least.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Staring at 22:00, should not we follow in the opposite of the gradient direction to reach minima? Gradient gives the steepest ascent directions as far as I know.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks Sir

### 16. Markov Chains I
My teacher was a total failure in teaching prob and stat. He is making my worst nightmare in a pleasant discovery.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor brings the subject to life..Excellent teachers make excellent learning... Most of my past teachers ought to be shot!!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He is making things more complicated than it is

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
i think it's obviously seen that he is from france as he pronounce "r" with french pronunciation

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Neat trick. Can we use this to find the circumference of an ellipse?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Hellow everyone. Please, Can someone tell me how the prof introduce the notion of transpose in the begining of video?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
my mind is crashed by that differential thing...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great error at 36.15 both functions are continuous in R-{0},there are no descontinuity points anywhere in their domain. He made a mistake, this is noth a removable discontinuity at x=0. He just make a extension of the domain to include zero and make the value of the functions in x=0 to be 1 to equal the limit.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Yes, it's still immortal in 2020.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Tell me again how much research do they do? And how much financial aid do they give? =P Just remind me.

### 4. Counting
For this semester, I am counting on you professor.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
God bless you!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
these kids are coming from high school with out hearing about vectors and determinants and they go to MIT?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I can't believe how he simplifies all those concepts.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]just mathematical

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I don't understand how vectors of N(A) can be in R^m ! If A is a m*n matrix, we need a R^n vector to have the 0 matrix, no ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm guessing it's included in required reading and the students will encounter it elsewhere.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
my professor is useless, Dr. Strang is so much more helpful

### 3. Independence
This is such a wonderful intellectual lecture i really enjoy listening  your lectures.
Thanks very much. Education is the only way in my humble opinion to  reduce the ignorance that tend to dominate the world in with we living today. 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
go figure

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like how much reinforcement it took for the MIT students to comprehend the idea that (1-cosΘ)/Θ goes to 0 as Θ goes to 0 because 1-cosΘ heads there quicker while I understood it the first time around. Made me feel slightly smart for a moment there.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I was in the Sheldon Axler camp that linear algebra should be taught abstractly with focus given to linear transformations from an almost exclusively algebraic point of view and hold off on determinants until the last possible second. Strang's lectures change all of that, these are the best lectures on linear algebra taught from the angle of matrix algebra. Both approaches are valuable but Strang really nails it. Deriving the determinant from properties like this provides excellent motivation versus just jotting the nasty formula down, it also helps with mathematical maturity since it forces understanding by the student.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
love

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
p（n）is just like f(x),alright ?

For anyone looking for some more visual intuition, 3blue1Brown has an amazing video on raising matrices to powers in his DE series.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Calculus is one of the most important inventions of human history. It has allowed us to explain the world around us. I hate d, I mean HATED math until I got to Calculus!! Then it all made sense. Sometimes i still get obsessed with Calculus.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Statistic is fun because i have able finding much of porn in stats

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This professor is great! Thank you!

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning

hwat?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
det(A)=aij*det(A-columni,rowj)*(-1)^n-1

very nice lecture, much better than any that i can find in my  university, thanks a lot MIT :)

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
"The key point is to think with them, not to just say here it is, listen up!  
I think the question all over again as they do. 
And you have to give time, you can't zip through a proof".

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
9:12

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
After understanding and enjoying all the lecture videos (1-27), this one and Jordan form one (lecture 28) disappointed me.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
We saw and able to proof that if a function is defferenciable, the it is continuous.  Does the same theorem goes to vice versa? that if a function is continuous, then it is defferenciable??

One thing i do know .... he's using lovely chalk.

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
people having trouble with the triangle can look at this video. It's the same instructor and same course just edX version of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFbBcabaQA

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Mathematics = lies about false identities perched over insanity & mortal delusions.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The key to understanding this lecture well is to follow along in a notebook.
The cameraman is not able to track the entire board for you to reference previous arguments.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I opened this to study PDE but.....

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 15:00, plugging in the vector <1,2,-1> into the equation is basically doing the dot product with the normal vector. This is because the plane equation IS a dot product of a known vector and an unknown. So if you plug in an unknown vector into x,y,z them that is basically the dot product.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
you want to learn linear algebra? you GOT  THE WHOLE INTERNET to learn tricks n tips.
you want to understand it?YOU have to COME here........

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Most people will know. But it's usually repeated just to make sure that everyone is on the same page. I mean different teachers and different classes sometimes uses different notations and perspectives so it's good to have a quick walk-through of everything before.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm studying exactly that at high school, which isn't  so complex at all...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
1-cos(theta) tends to zero faster than arc length (= theta), so it becomes  like -- 0 divided my any number so its zero

### 12. Iterated Expectations
Amazingly explained!

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Like if you watched It at 1.5x velocity

Any help is appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He constantly stops and asks if theres questions, and he elaborates on subjects he feels are pretty trick to catch at first. good teacher.  not as sharp of a dresser as professor donald sadoway though :)

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
memorylessness can be expressed as P(X > m+n | X > m) = P(X > n)

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]there is an error for those who are hard of hearing. Pho should be "rho" the Greek letter. The captions are absolutely greatly appreciated by myself and many others. Thank you to those who put in that work on this channel.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
@[USERNAME]i think the E(X) sud be = b-a/2

### 14. Regression (cont.)

i wish i had a teacher like this. he clearly expresses a strong fundamental understanding of the field, and can explain it clearly to minds of all sorts.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Ever great lectures, thanks professor Strang and MIT.Merci la vie!

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He means that as many the powers that many the ratios ex 1/x^4=  A/x^4 +B/x^3 +C/x^2  +D/x + all other dactors

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Thank you


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you to whoever did the closed captioning (subtitles) on this - tedious work, but very appreciated.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
How does this idea transfer to eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of differential operators? They don't quite look like matrices, do they?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
thanks.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Too bad this course is ruined by discontinuity... There seems to be a whole lecture missing, they should have added also the second lecture from 2017 at least. It's better to have some overlap than missing data.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Think of it this way. Let's say the wheel did not turn but was simply dragged. The curve describing the path of a point on the wheel would be equal to the displacement of the wheel. Similarly, if the wheel did not move but simply turned in place the arc length would be 2pi for each revolution. The cycloid includes both the revolution and the translation as part of its length.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I wish I had teachers like Prof Gilbert Strang when I studied linear algebra. What a difference makes to have someone dedicated to explaining the geometry of what is going on.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am watching this lectures, I understand them, but when I go to solve the Psets, seems I dont know shit.... anyone having the same issue with the Psets?

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
in greece, applied probability is a standard course in order to get accept to any economically oriented university.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
So elegantly explained. You are a master, Professor Tsitsiklis

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Hi, does the i in this video stand for imaginary number or i hat ?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
In 2020 Gilly Strang woulda been #MeToo into oblivion for mentioning Monica

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
by 'all 3 by 3 matrix', does he mean matrix has 3 rows and 3 column?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
how come this one has more views than the last one (almost doubled)

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Man, u know why since lecture 23 or sth the views sinks🤣: u have to read the book to clarify to yourself about the important points the Prof Strang has leave there purposely, which is actually elegant😀 now I go to read the book to find out why the sign of pivots are the same as the of EV..

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
If I told younger me that I was going to be watching MIT videos to actually learn the content they are teaching, I would never believe it. yet here I am studying for an exam.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Is it me or most of us, that it was a bit hard to catch up with previous LA classes of Prof. Strang. Now I know the reason, which was expressed by the professor himself in this video.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i would of though MIT would be able to afford a electronic board 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHH!!! <3

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
how can i find the number of  pivot in a matrix ?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Outclass teaching skills! No queries in my mind whatsoever

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am grade 9 in germany and I have understand a lot

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
45:28 "I'm very positive about positive definite matrices." This is epic.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the videos mit! I watch em everyday...


### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Thank you Professor Strang and MIT.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The passion for mathematics and teaching it, shines through you and it is really infectious. Forever grateful. <3

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks professor Strang.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Love this guy. I'm teaching a course like this, and am taking notes. These lectures are a pleasure to listen to! :)

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the why he says "zero" -- ziho ziho

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great, then I assume you've at least browsed the mathematics courses MIT actually has to offer? This is a course which you may or may not have to take depending on individual circumstances and your field of interest. This material and 18.03 Differential Equations is sufficient for much of physics, so it really doesn't matter when you actually cover it as long as you end up knowing it.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Did not know he's this old. I wonder when the lecture videos were recorded.
Just so sad to see a brilliant mind like him has to age.
I love his  video lectures.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Try studying in India. You finish this by 10th grade :/

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
This would be much better had a noise-cancelling microphone been used.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
That was too good, " poor misbegotten subspace",...🤣🤣...He is too good....

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
Excellent !

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Excellent!

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍

### 34. Final Course Review
Just finished after 11 weeks of watching all the lectures, doing all the homeworks, and taking all the exams.  Cannot thank Prof. Strang and MIT enough for creating and posting this series of lectures.  It's so rare to find an obviously brilliant mathematician who actually seems to enjoy teaching introductory-level courses, and Prof. Strang was such a joy to spend ~30 hours with through these videos.  I've taken Linear Algebra before but needed a refresher after 10 years, and this course was perfect for walking me through the concepts.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Question: the x-particular needs to have 0 corresponding to the free variables in A, and in order to find the free variables in A you need to row reduce it, but after you have done this, why can't you just arbitrarily select numbers for the pivot variables in x-particular? Why solve for them by setting some "b" when the vector is going to give some valid "b" anyways?

### 9. Reducibility
In the proof for "E_TM is undecidable" in the construction of M_w you don't even need to Check, whether x != w. You can Just Run M on w for all x. Then the language of M_w is either Sigma* or empty.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
while listening to lecture, one has some general concerns, excellent part of the professor is he addresses most of my concerns without me asking!!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Thank you.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Lec 8 is missing !

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought why he was spending so much time on this particular case at the beginning, then at 38th minute... wow!!

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
stfu you little troll

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Self note: 45, please future me remember what this means lol

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow I learnt all these in high school during my jee preperation 😁😁🔥🔥

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
This is truly remarkabe teaching. Greatly helps understanding and intuition of what SGD actually does. prof. Sra's proof of SGD convergence for non-convex optimization is in prof. Strang's excellent book "Linear Algebra & Learning From Data", p.365

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
This is so helpful, thanks alot!

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Thank you very much Dr. Strang for making this intuitive and natural. I had only gone through SVD in bits and pieces and never had what I could consider a good enough understanding until I saw this lecture.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Trump learned from Him how to wear a tie.

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
At 42:15, how would I find the projection matrix, if the inverse of Atranspose*A doesn't exist, such as in this example?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Seriously MIT, chalk and a blackboard?......IT´S MIT!!! they should have had already a computer voice recognition software that can laser the command of the teacher into a screen...

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Jesus man, I remember back before I started college when I checked out Prof Strang’s calculus series. 
He’s aged quite a lot since that series, but he’s always sharp as a tack. And I’m just astonished that even being so old he knows so much about machine learning, I didn’t think it was his field. 
Huge kudos Gilbert Strang, huge kudos.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I have started a PhD and my research area is applied deep learning. I have to do multiple things in parallel. There is a lot of material available related to Deep learning on the internet and I am confused that which one is worthful for my research. So can anyone comment on this course that, how much this course is useful for me?

Thanx a lot Mr.Strang and MIT

### 3. Independence
All in all these lectures are great, but sadly it seems to be he doesn't really reply properly to the question the student asks @ around 20 min in - it seems to me the student is correct, and that the Venn Diagram is akward in explaining exactly what he asks about. Maybe because the event B with probability = 0 is poorly pictured using anything but a point, in a venn diagram.
Please comment on this to enlighten me of alternative views on the subject.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
I can't continue the course anymore, the last 30 minutes of this lecture seems to be way too much for me. *after trying to understand the first 15 minutes of his last 30 minutes for an hour and I'm still confused. 
Appreciate your work Professor Strang. It's a great experience learning from you. 
Got this lecture bookmarked, I'll return to it one day

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is anyone else bothered by poor camera movement? It focuses on the professor while missing the board many times. 

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For those following along with the course:

Session 16: Intersection of a Line and a Plane 11:00
Session 17: General Parametric Equations; the Cycloid 25:34
Session 18: Point (Cusp on Cycloid) 41:45

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
29:51 that’s why electron clouds are drawn as balloons with really solid surface areas. We can draw the surface of the solid that the electron is in 95% of the time (or whatever P is if it is not 95%) because of “convergence in probability”.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
At t = 21:00, Strang covers the definition of inversion (and at 32:00 he gives an example): first suppose A is an n x m matrix. Then if you have a left inverse L that acts on A, it will produce an identity matrix, call it I_n; similarly, If you have a right inverse R, when A acts on R it will also produce an identity matrix, call it I_m. So a Matrix is non-singular (sometimes mistakenly called regular) only if  m = n, A is square, and det(A) (does not) = 0. In particular, if the matrix A have full rank = n, all its columns and rows would be independent, so A would be invertible.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The audio is messed up on this one.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
please don't zoom the whole frame to the professor, I can't see the writings on the boards in that way...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you can, because that law is rote memorization before you learn the proof, and mit regularly decline perfect SATs anyhow..they just don't care

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
5/32 is the probability of x-1/2
(5/24)/(4/3) are the areas

Probability is so more interesting that the integration formulas (what I'm doing at school)

### 25. Classical Inference III

Such clarity and elocuence! Great lecture

### 16. Markov Chains I
Why did we use condition probability for r21(n) @46:00. Why is r21(n) not 0.3 instead?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
32:12 I do not understand why are the resulting vectors called u1 and u2. I expect Ax1 and Ax2 to be there as a result of A multiplication. If U multiplication is rotation, than u1 and u2 are just rotated unit vectors (exactly as v's, different rotation)... Can somebody prove me wrong please?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:20 no one asked the following question: we write dV/dt or dt/dh all the time, but what is this "t" variable is? Where did it come from?

These videos are great.  They are basically what you would get in any intro calc course. If your really want to excel in calc, you could read ahead (if you have the time and inclination).  Do lots of problems!  Without the heavy lifting on your part, these videos will not help you as much.

What is the instructor's name? I really appreciate is educational method of teaching. I learned a lot about exponential functions from him. Thank you.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
dang he even covers part of continuous distribution what an amazing lecture.

### Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators
At 53:30, you could just pick a orthonormal basis of Null(T)^\perp. Since the rank of T is finite, then the dim of  Null(T)^\perp is finite. The basis hence formed does the job.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The dart board problem. It turns out to be 1% and he says that's pretty high? Seems to me 1% is pretty low.

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
I have to say that the quality of the hypothesis testing section is not as good as estimation section. And why the sample variance is not divided by n-1?

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am a little confused. It seems to me that u-axis and v-axis should not be perpendicular to each other. 

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
something wrong with this lecture, 32:39, A^{100}u_0=SM^100c. Here I use M to substitute the eigenvalue diagonal matrix. The professor said A^{100}u_0=M^100Sc which is not correct.

I pay 40k a year for my linalg professor to read through slides…

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Considering its MIT, many have already taken the course ahead of this one in high school. However, this is a much more rigorous version of the course. Obviously this is the first lecture so the lecturer is simply demonstrating the concepts.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
WOW! i was expecting to see any answer, i saw the whole video just for that... But using 9 boards... jaja that's too much for me! i didn't understand anything though, i haven't seen maths since 2009... :( thx anyway!

Thank you for this amazing journey. This project is really exceptional. And my calculus foundation is finally strong :) Excellent lecturers, clear recitation videos and plenty of exercises for practice. This cannot be better. MIT is leading the way. Thank you once more.

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
but chalk rocks (no pun intended of course)

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
The video format for a lecture is super udnerrated... nothing like being able to control time. You can even pause mid lecture, complete exercises, and then resume.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
wonder why this lecture is cut so short

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Awesome series! However, starting at 31:00 he's using loose language and is not very precise with notation (or I am missing something). IMHO, it is not correct to write Y=g(X). Moreover, below that he is also writing g(x) (lower case "x"). I think the correct ought to be Y=g o X (where "o" is function composition). Only then does g(x) (lowercase "x") make sense. Otherwise if what he is writing "Y=g(X)" is the correct form, what is the domain of g?

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
Professor Strang this is another great lecture on Backpropagation and finding partial derivatives from a computational graph. Calculus is still an important piece of all upper level  mathematics.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]Well technically yes if you exchange the 2nd and 3rd row. Pivot point on the 2nd row would then be 4, third row -2. Row echolon form is not unique (meaning how you solve it and what numbers will show up depend on the person). However, once you reduce it, RREF is unique (solution should be the same for everyone). 

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
22:29 it could be x2 = f(x^0)
isn´t it?

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is a great lecture, and Prof Jerison seems a very good teacher.
However, although I followed and understood this without any problems, this is only because *I am familiar with the notion of integral anyway*, having already covered it in my mathematical education up to this point.

If this lecture was my first exposure to this stuff, I think I'd have been pretty confused about what was going on, with the speed that Jerison went and the way in which he introduced the concepts and notations: the integral sign and the dx on the end just suddenly appearing out of nowhere.

On the MIT website, it says that no prior knowledge of calculus is required to take this course: although this is technically true, I think I'd struggle if I'd never seen any of this before.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:09 why the range of r goes from 0 to 1? I think the definition of S in this problem needs further clarification. S should be a paraboloid of z = x^2 + y^2 between z=0 and z=1. It is a little confusing by justing saying "above the unit disk".  

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
no creo que consigas en español, es estados unidos, asi que triste y todo pero todo del MIT está en inglés!

### 14. Poisson Process I

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 6:25, df is defined to be an infinitesimal change in Δf, so shouldn't that be a number too. Like in 18.01, we considered it to be  one of the three dimensions while calculating volume of revolution. Can someone help??

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
Dr. Strang & MIT open- you are a gift to entire field of engineering

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Don't you just feel his love and warmth! Gauss would have been so proud.


His 18.06 course are one of the greatest treasures of online education, just like Khan Academy Cardiology, Hans Bethe quantum mechanics lectures, Andrew Ng's machine learning course, Jeremy Howard's fast.ai course and Gerald Sussman's SICP computer science course.


Thank you so much MIT OCW....you have changed the world with your MOOCs!

### Lecture 14: Limits of Functions in Terms of Sequences and Continuity
Whats the point of this

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
NICE LECTURE....there is 1 doubt at 23:00....how was F(x)=root of pie divide by 2?? please reply

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Great work

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Also the most Abstract math seems like. 

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
I found this lecture quite confusing.  His last example of computing (AB)C vs A(BC) is the key idea.  The blog article he talks about I think misses the main computational point because it focuses on the composition of 2 functions and there is little computational advantage between forward vs. backward with only two functions.  

In case it might help others, here is how I think about it: Say everything is linear but the variables have different dimensions:
F(x)=F3(F2(F1(x))
start with variable x (input layer)
h1=F1(x) = Cx (hidden layer 1)
h2=F2(h1)=B*h1  (hidden layer 2)
y=F3(h2)=A*h2 (output layer)
Then F(x)=A*B*C*x and jacobian(F)=A*B*C
Forward differentiation first computes derivatives of h2 wrt x by multiplying jacobians (JF2)*(JF1).  Then finds derivative of y wrt x by multiplying by JF3 --> so this is A*(B*C)
Backward differentiation first computes derivatives of y wrt h1 by multiplying jacobians (JF3)*(JF2).  Then finds derivative of y wrt x by multiplying by JF1 --> so this is (A*B)*C

In a neural network, you might have x very large N-dimensional input (pixels in an image), hidden layers h1 and h2 with a moderate n-number of dimensions, and output y a scalar (probability the network thinks image is a cat).
So forward differentiation computes A*(B*C) -> cost is 1*n*N + n^2*N
backward differenations computes (A*B)*C costs 1*n^2 + 1*n*N

### 34. Final Course Review
You're a bit confused. He teaches 34 sections of 18.06, staggered so that each one starts the day after the last, and about 45 minutes later. This was just one continuous 24 hour period of teaching with the order reversed for our convenience. It's more efficient that way; just the kind of innovation we expect from MIT.

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]

hey, do you understand the first part when he stated that ( d/dx +x ) y = 0, translates to dy/dx +xy = 0? 

I'm a little confused about that. i see from the first equation that was a give that dy/dx = f(x) = y. Therefore y should equal dy/dx, so shouldn't the equation be (d/dx)(dy/dx) = -xy? 



### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
@[USERNAME]"no mathematics involved here, just making a vector stand up" :'D

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he tells you that t is nx^(n-1) which is a way to find the deri\vative. there are other rules i dont know why he wouldnt go over it.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
sadly i'm too stupid to understand this.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Take the integral from 0meters to (a meters) if along the y axis and from 0 meters to the (square root of a meters) if along the x direction i.e. use UNITS. This helps ensure the units of the answer come out properly. Again, dont delete k in y=kx^2 because its numerically equal to one, the units are needed. k=1/(1 meter). k is exact so does not effect significant figures of your answer.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
His derivation of the derivative of a power is understandably "simplified" but I found it a bit sloppy. The actual derivation uses sums of infinite series. It's weird, because he's using the properties of infinitesimals without explicitly saying so

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When the professor uses the term "speed"; I believe he should be using the term "velocity". My understanding is that speed = |velocity|. That is speed (magnitude) is always positive, where velocity may be positive or negative (magnitude and direction). 

Nice lecture series... Thanks, MIT

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Professor Strang ,this is a really useful lecture that starts with classical topics in mathematics. Linear Programming and Two- Persons Games are large topics in applied mathematics.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
dtan(x)/dx = 1+tan^2(x) so darctan(x)/dx = 1/(1+x^2) because dx/dy = 1/(dy/dx).

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The black board trick never gets old...XD

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks, Professor. You are a global treasure.

### 4. Counting
how AnB is 8??

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
These are great lectures! Is the autograder and programming assignment available somewhere?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
"I never drew a pi-e before..." GOD I love this man!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Respected old man,his hair grow more white.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
How come they did not applaude at the end? OMG you are awesome man!!

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
24:12 why Sir was standing like that???

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I want to tell all math enthusiasts out there to never give up, because maths is difficult for everyone... You can see even mr. Strang says sometimes he gets lost, and he teaches this stuff for years. (I felt this was missing in the comments) btw. *what a living legend!*

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
This was too late for me 😂 But this is great for the others😍

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Im really suprised how young, full of energy and smart this guy is.Thats what i call pure talent(or genias?)

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
This course gives me an intense urge to raise my hand with the answer to the professor's questions!! (Ofc, unlike the live audience, I have the benefit of the pause button :P)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thank you MIT you are the best !

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
what is alpah bita and gamama etc
answer me quick tomorrow i have paper
and  i don't know

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get it. So it's okay if we have a limit like 0/0, but a limit like 0/1 is wrong, is that right?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
HI guys am a student at BOTHO UNIVERSITY IN BOTSWANA STUDING COMPUTER SCIENCE.I realy like Proff John Tsitsiklis.PROBABILITY MODELS AND AXIOMS wish i attended at M.I.T   .....

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Are there any lecture notes?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This is enlightening! thank you prof

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I really really do enjoy watching/learning this, my prof. isn't doing a good job.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
At https://youtu.be/YzZUIYRCE38?t=615, Professor Strang applies FOIL to vectors.  I'm not clear on why you can do that.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Big Difference.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
What did he mean by the Dimensions?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
To all those who didn't exactly got why dr/ds=(u hat), try understanding this way of explanation:
In the X-Y plane lets just take R(r vector) to be the position vector of a point in X-Y plane. Now if we move a length ds along u vector(U), the position vector of the point will change by amount dR. Thus, if you draw a picture of what I just said, you will understand this that,                                                                                                                                                             (R +dR) - (R) = (ds)(U hat). That is dR=(ds)(u hat). And thus dR/ds=(u hat).

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
"You've taken linear algebra. You've taken calculus." Buddy, not even close. But please, continue! >.<

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
"Statistics is about replacing expectations with averages ... everytimes you see an expectation you replace it by an average"  this resume all this lecture.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
you can also swap 1,2 and then 3 with one of them.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Excellent explaination

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
what prerequisted  for this 18.06 ?

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice


### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He could have answered the students question better by explaining that theta was tending to zero by the center moving out rather than the lines closing in.  He tried to say that but didn't explain it right.

If you view it this way, the top is tending towards zero while the bottom is a constant.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I love it how he does not even need to explain it carefully, but everyone was already interested in Linear Algebra taught by him. He really encourages students to brainstorm other insights based on strong background that he could provide them.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
THAT IS SEXY

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
Lessons are very clear and understandable, however the one who writes all the subtitles doesn't know anything about the lecture because there are too many mistakes at the subtitles.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the explanation of the fondamental limit is quite.... sick

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
31:23 "One more time"... "No"  GET ROASTED SON

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you so much MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I think it would be better for someone who already have linear algebra background. I learned something from another perspective. The meaning behind it. 
For new learners, it is still hard.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's generally what discussion or recitation sections are for, not lectures.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
20:26

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I was almost done with the lectures but then today I saw that there were suddenly 36 instead of 35 videos in this series. I was confused and started scrolling through the video playlist to see what I missed and stumbled upon this gem :) He looks different on the outside but he acts the same and is the same on the inside <3

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Linear Algebra has been my good old friend for several decades, but now I see a fresh look at my friend that looks much younger, all this thanks to the amazing profession Prof. Dr. Gilbert Strang. The essence of the timeless reverence Guru Brahma proved again. I shall be going through the entire series, even though, I wish I had this opportunity a decade and half ago. 🙏

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
May God make this man eternal

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
I love him!!! deeply!!!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Maybe I don't have basic in Mathematics, but when I read Prof Strang books about linear algebra (all deep learning for my dream project in machine learning). And now I introduced to Prof Strang OpenCourse, I'm feeling blessed and inspired as Computer Programmer Learner. Thanks to MIT & Prof Strang from East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia. 🙏🙏🙏

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Here, before GATE 2022

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
they always use easy examples in lecture, come the exam it takes 45 minutes to solve lol

### 24. Classical Inference II
Wow, I really made it through (almost) :D

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
out of curiosity, i did the math on e^(-3x)*(1+x)^(-1/2). it's a long and messy road but you'll end up with 1-(7/2)x.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Why are the parameters of one of the normal distributions he describes identifiable and the others aren't?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This lecture invoked me much inspiration!! 
교수님 연금 달달하십니까

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thanks for providing such a lecture

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
35:00 
recap

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Whoa, I had a serious  aha moment here!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I wish I did watched it at 2000.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Well boys, future starts here.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
A big thanks to MIT and YouTube to be able to share this valuable content with everyone around the world. I would've never imagined if I could ever learn from a MIT professor. Truly appreciate the opportunity. Stay safe and wish y'all the best.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Is this course a prerequisite for machine learning?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Great Lecture. Could anyone answer my question:
I understand that error vector (b-p) is smallest when e is orthogonal to column space. What I am confused at is the squared error portion. Using projection, I thought what was solved is the Xhat that could minimize the error vector instead of error square. Could anyone help me clarifying this?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hes a class lecturer. I envy anyone who had him in college.

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
Is it just me? Is that a mistake? He writes x=Wc at 37:11, where x represents vector in the old basis, and c the vector in the new basis, and W the columns of new basis vectors. Should it be c=Wx instead?

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
You still have to admit...it is cool, common or not...it. is. epic.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank u sir

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Just a litte typo that I came across throught out this perfect lecture is the "confusion region": min(a_i/b_i) and max (a_i/b_i) should be min(b_i/a_i) and max (b_i/a_i).

Generally speaking, this lecture is the best explanation on SGD I have ever seen. Again, thank you prof. Sra and thank you MITOpenCourseWare so so much 👍👏

P/s: Any other resources that I've read explained SGD so complicatedly 😔

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
really well explained but may need to watch twice if you are completely new to conditional probability concept.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Love his lectures but I think there's a little mistake in there, correct me if I'm wrong. Professor Strang said {(1,1,2),(2,2,5),(3,3,8)} makes a basis for R^3, but can't that set of vectors only produce vectors where x1 and x2 are equal? So you cant get (1,0,0) from the vectors and certainly not the entirety of R^3, right? The first and second row would even be the exact same written as a Matrix, so they should be linearly dependent for that reason as well. Again, maybe I'm overlooking something but it doesn't add up for me.

Edit: Should have sorted comments by new first, it seems a lot of people saw this too but it didn't make it to the top comments

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
In Romania we do this in high-school, 10th grade or something like that... and you're doing it at MIT? Great course(video) though

### 17. Markov Chains II
very clear !

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Are projection matrices always symmetric? Professor seems to say so. Is this correct?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gratitude from India.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
the most interesting algebra ever. thank you professor!!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
hey guys, i have a quesion to ask and i appreciate if someone can help answer my question.
When the prof tried the free column, he tried (x,1, x, 0) and (x, 0, x, 1), this is understandable. But can i try one more which is (x, 1, x, 1) ??!!
thank you with regards.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks Prof. Strang , I really liked your course very much. Thank you so much

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
My high school teacher moves way faster than this guy and at 8:00 AM when I still am not awake. Someone should talk to her.

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
OMG I was literally like didn't they fight in the revolutionary war? then he makes a joke about it 🤓

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
At 1:05 he says "What does a matrix do? It acts on vectors". I just love the way he looks at the matrices. He is definitely a "matrix" artist.  Every time I watch his video, I get a feeling that I learnt something new. Absolutely brilliant sir!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
oh sir thank you a lot !!!!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
So if you had to boil the topic of this lecture down into 1 main idea, is it that the probability of a whole set is the sum of the probabilities of each individual set? 

Seems very simple, not sure if I missed anything

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
lecture 1: 60k views
lecture 2: 6k views
lecture 3: ...

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
I have not watched this yet, although I am very excited to. Anyone that is struggling to get the big picture (or motivation in general) of functional analysis can check out the book Functional Analysis for Physics and Engineering by Hiroyuki Shima.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
hmm it seems the person that who truly appears dumb is yourself haha according to the person on the bottum

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I m guessing I am the smallest guy who watched this lecture

### 18. Properties of Determinants
The best determinant lecture I had!

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know this is a stupid question but can some explain why r=2acos theta as opposed to 2asec theta?

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Interesting proof: showing  probability of two separate coincidental events being larger than  the probability of a single event occurring in the universe of events by saying that they are not coincidental events, however,  but 1 single event with a larger probability than a single event occurring in the specific universe. Very clever.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Now all the learners of this course know what happened about Monica LOL. I think at the end of 2010s many of unis students do not know these 1990s things.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
What an inspiring lecture

### 24b. Quiz 2 Review
DR. Strang, from looking at your pass quizzes at MIT  they seem very challenging to me. There are many twist and turns in your quizzes. I hope that the MIT students are learning linear algebra that stays with them forever. These students are supposed to be the world's brightest.

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
SEXUAL Harassment!

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
31:53 what is this "natural notation"? 
I wish he derived that form from u(t) = c1e^(λt)x1

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thank you for posting !

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Why the number of operation is equal to n^2 ? Can anyone ?

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh my cheese sticks!!! I actually understood (some of) what he was saying. Kudos to the professor!!!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
did this guy do the voice for the T-rex in toy story?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
If the rows of a matrix are dependent, does it mean that the columns must be dependent too?

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Can you share your slide please?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
LOL.. I wonder if he brought the chain especially for explaining why that derivative called a chain derivative ! It was a wrong explanation anyway!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Teachers does not represent the school. It's students who absorb the subject and learned from it. It is not school but the learned knowledge. Oftentimes graduates felt they knew anything about the science they learned ending up looking for genetically common financial aspects. Recovery of education invested.Where is this knowledge dumped these days?Facilties uses this knowhow?What are they doing now?Labor expensive. Application minimal. R&D?Always money matters 4 survival. Survival exploits.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there Any Course on Basic Electronics

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
in minute  10:34   the last right matrix  the last pivot element should be -3 because we multiply the previous one by 2 in 2nd row and add to 3rd row so, the element (3,3) should be -3 otherwise it will be 3 if we multiply by -2 and subtract

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Absolute legend. Every time I hear him is an education!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
great professor ... amazing teaching method and he clearly has developed an astonishing intuition over the concepts, Bit Thumbs up from me!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Thank you Sir

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I see that they jump right into max and min, the hessian, etc after this...


do they cover this topics on this class??

limit and continuity for multiple variable functions
diferential calculus of multiple variable functions(things like, directional derivatives, supirior order partial derivatives C1 class, c2 class, etc...,Scharwz theorem,chain rule)
inverse and implicit theorems of multiple variable functions


beacouse in my multiple variable calculus class.  firts I had the review of vectors, parametrics ecuations and all of that, then I had topology and then the list of the thing I listed above(where I am currently in) and after that I´m going the have max and min, lagrange and with that I finish half of my calculus class, after I will see multiple variable integral calculus and after that to finish the course vectorial calculus(green, stokes and all of that)

so do this course cover that??? and if not wath should I be looking for?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yea but if you use an errorfunction constricted to a higher power function then that function will go to zero when x goes to zero. Use ordo. 
So in that case you just need to use the second order maclaurin term to solve the problem and ofcourse the ordo term constricted to x^4. Then you get the a really easy problem.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I watched this lecture maybe three times. and still screaming. thank you Prof. Gilbert Strang

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
“Well don’t speak all at once” 👍 gotta love his sense of humor !

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 17:10 answer: y = -1/2g(t*t)  + v(start)t + y(start) [equation for a free falling body]

the body is at 80 feet and gravity(g) = 10 and v(start) = 0
hence y= -5(t*t) + 80  

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
>Calclulus BC AP exam tomorrow

IT'S HAPPENING

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
Usually this guy is great when teaching linear algebra, but I think he got thrown into this course for couple days and was unprepared. I mean that discussion when off track quick.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
44:15 <--- ¿ inverted question mark! the teacher maybe speaks spanish.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
48:14 that guy totally knew he was blocking the camera

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
According to the course calendar, Assignment 1 is due on the same day as Lecture 2, i.e. this lecture. But this lecture contains material that is needed to be able to work on Assignment 1. In fact, towards the end of the lecture, the prof gives a sketch of how to solve Exercise 6 of Assignment 1. Why is this?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
równowaznosc wierszowa i klumnowa; amerykanie ...

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I think the main point of this lecture is not to find the solution at all, but to know when you can find it. So you can watch in perspective and answer when you can and when you cannot to find it. That's the reason for what he did'nt begun by putting numbers as results of the equations, but with literals, meaning they can be any number and the answer to that system just can be found if those numbers meet the condition of beeing a mix of every column in the matrix.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
8:00 isn't it the integration of the area of semicircle 🤔

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You’re a wonderful teacher

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Very clear and natural to follow the lesson. Thank Professor Strang so much. Btw, his books are also very wonderful.

### 4. Counting
Counting means adding.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks MIT

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
intuition behind  linear regression is awesome..

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Lec6 done.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Some of the questions made were very naive.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I've studied linear algebra from another online source, and that's given me a great foundation, but this lecture has really helped me to SEE the matrix multiplication from a higher level. Before this video, I hadn't considered that the left multiplication can be thought of as applying row operations.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome stuff, thanks MIT!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
They don't "need" donations. They don't need to give away content for free either but they still do.

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is not rate of change it is variation with respect to one variable to another variable.whenever you say rate of change only time factor is involved in it.it refers to variable changes with time.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can't L'Hopital's rule be explained geometricly? what about the functions curves' tangancy ?

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
his teaching is rigorous, precise, strict and concise, to the point, helps me clarifying the cloudy understanding in statistics.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
No offense but you should be studying English instead of Linear Algebra.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watch in 1.5 speed, makes it far more bearable

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hey, so will ((d^a)/(dx)^a) * x^n be equal to (n!/(n-a)!) * n^(x-a)

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]then you can use rectangular coordinates. cylindrical method is good when there is a circle (projection) on xy-plane

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions
"Some make simple things complex and Some make complex things simple"
Thank you, Sir Sipser❤️
Thank you, MIT
Thank you, YouTube

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah, his handwriting is good. I noticed that early on.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Cospiover4=cospiover4

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I keep answering his questions, then laugh about it. He is a great engaging professor :)
Like if you are doing the same thing

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Rather watch one of the lectures on PCA by Prof Ali Ghodsi.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Some things require only a textbook.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Personally, for the limit around 30 minutes, I used the fact that the hundredth derivative of x^100 is 100! and factored it out along with p^100.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
At 14:20 the dimension formula is more intuitive if stated as dim(S) + dim(U) - dim(S∩U) = dim(S+U)    i.e. " the dimension of S added to the dimension of U minus the dimention of the interscetion of  S and U is the dimension of S+U"  ... so much easier to visualize stated that way n'est-ce pas?

### 16. Markov Chains I
If a teacher makes it complicated then he is not a good teacher. If he makes it super easy then only he is a good teacher. :-)

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
12:06 book recommended

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Where is the follow-up lecture on PCA it seems to be missing from the following lectures?

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
watch this for better explanation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l27xKSNad2Y

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]stop wishing and do something about it

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
is W1=T(V1) W2=T(V2)...? because the transformation output doesnt always have to be a base for the space, it only happens to be when the transformation is an isomorphism between the two spaces.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I'd say if you play this video at speed 1.5, it's even more awesome!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Cramer's Rule starts at 20:00

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
thanks Prof and MIT

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Momentum forsenCD

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
My lecturer shared this link in online classes saying this link will direct to free NordVPN. Now I've became software engineer and I regret

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Wouldn't the z-axis be orthogonal to the entire x-y plane?  It kind of goes against one of his remarks in the 20-21 minute part of the video.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
This is another great lecture by MIT Professor DR. Gilbert Strang. Least Squares put linear algebra into another world by itself.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
my doubt  in this lecture: sir told dA' is the area of the square in uv coordinates,but acc. to the diagram it dA' is the area of a parallelogram whose sides are not parallel to uv axes,how can that be possible

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Good content, but it sure does seem to move a little slow.  Maybe it'll pick up pace; I'm only half an hour into lecture 1.

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Very good content to understand Bayesian inference. Thanks prof.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
That is True

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I know the definition of a Limit and watch this courses for pure enjoyment, don't get me wrong, he is great explaining, but nither of those two things you say is the point. First, anybody can probably find many places that explain the definition of a Limit, and second, even if he talks about limits more as lecures go on, he should've defined it before using it in the first place. Limit and its definition usually go first in most Calculus courses.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not to be weird or anything, but I swear I can hear his heartbeat. 😂

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I'll prefer a discussion of a practicl cases...Physics Electrical

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Thanks a lol way much clearer

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]i don't get what ur saying but Thnx.
Anyway, i think i may have found the solution. 
When he was talking about line L, i thought L was a subspace of P (also his diagram of L kind of looks like L is inside P) . If it was, than P U L=P & P itself is a subspace of P.So P U L is a subspace of P.
But if he was talking about L that passes through orgin but doesn't lies in plane P (so L penetrates P), than ofcourse P U L will not be subspace of P. 
So my interpretation of L was wrong.lol

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
so the goal or purpose of this lecture was to achieve Minimizing _x_ Subject to Ax = b is my assessment accurate?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Next time, please put the main topic of each lecture in the video title.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thats cool chalk.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
because knowledge is more important for them than their appearance

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i still get confused with derivative notations sometimes. when he differentiated x^2+y^2=1 why did the differentiated form of y have y' on it?? i see that happen when we differentiate y but why do i have y' included and not just 2y.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finally it is making sense that learning is made simple by method it is taught to us

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
there is always someone who is unhappy as he said!

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
where is the proof of 39b) for the paralellopipe?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Should he add x hat at 12:58?

### 4. Counting
Simple most, step by step, taking all kinds of examples with not a single extra word ! So, everybody praises MIT . Thanks MIT for the OCW for the whole world .♥️🙏

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Superb lectures

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I only new from his books and lectures of him i watched online. 
What a brilliant man.

MIT folks who had a chance with knowing in person are extremely lucky.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
I am a statistician that watching this video :)))

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
@[USERNAME]why would there be a square root 2 pi there, I don't get the significance of what he is saying when there are no fudge factors and this is the true asymptotic variance. Why would there be any of that?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor was very humble.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really like how the final result can be interpreted intuitively with some geometry. It shows how a bit of human intuition can transcend a lot of mechanistic elaborate calculations.

### 4. Counting
I LOVE MIT LECTURES

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just a phenomenal professor and course. I looked at a couple lectures to help one of my kids in her calc course and ended up doing the whole class because it was so enjoyable. ENJOYABLE! Great job MIT. The effort you put into these OCW courses is really appreciated.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:25 I think he meant electrical potential difference is voltage, electrical potential itself is not the same as voltage.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
I've looked at a lot of  explanations for Eiganvectors and eiganvalues but this is the first one to clearly identify the vectors in R3. and to show how  zero lambdas represent vectors in the null space.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]can you explain to me how it is incorrect? please brush up on your metric units before criticizing a professor at MIT :)

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Only determinant is the topic that’s does catch my interest.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He should have groupies.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So pancakes follow vectors? 


I promise you they do. ;)

### Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function
Why did we include the x=c in the continuity part ( |x-c|<delta), while the definition of limits does not include x=c (0<|x-c|<delta)?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
colourful box changes all! 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love you sir from Kashmir

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Instead of writing "Eg" he writes "Example" 
.
DEDICATION LEVEL

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
auroux is great.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
how did i end up here and why am i still watching it?


### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
on 07:08, he doesn't seem to care about the dx. While there is an absence of dx is in the discrete setting, there is dx for every sum in our continuum. Does that not make the difference, becuase rather than have a continuum sum of infinitisemal f(x) we have a continuum sum of f(x)dx?  so it should be Ave(F'(x))(dx)(delta_X). Can anyone Clarify?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It was fun watching this lecture. Thank you for posting this.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
@[USERNAME]

I made that comment two years ago. Can you imagine me saying that aloud in a MIT classroom?? lmao. That's why I don't go there...

Believe it or not, I'm not that shallow. Don't judge my character based on that one comment. I'm teacher's assistant for a calculus lab at my university now. I have 23 students. lol.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
uuuu the quality in this video is better than the another on the previous playlist

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
GUYS HOW DO I KNOW THE HOMEWORK?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The benefits of learning from the person who wrote textbooks on the subject 🤔😀Awesome!!!!!!! He’s math lab—Awesome again😀😀😀 Where was this guy when I was taking Pre-Calculus 1 and 2!!!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Thank you MIT OpenCourseWare..Prof. Strang is God, Not only MIT students the whole World deserves a great teacher like him.
A student from India

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
all of a sudden i'm heavily interested in linear algebra and math

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
You still have that strong voice!!!! 
And WHY ARE YOU AGING????

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Come to India and these things are taught in school 😁😁😁

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Believe me . Please upload all of the lecture you teach on campus. You are smarter when you do that because you will get the feedback and learn a lot

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i pay 1000€/year and need to learn a lot more than they teach on these videos... at least 1 thing is great in Portugal =) 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This is fascinating, but can you elaborate on this further? Quantity and quality of what? Instruction? Research? Both? What human resources are they using or importing to make this happen and from where are they getting it? This is a great reply by the way.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The problem here is that he's using "delta" which they've already been thought to call the "average" in place of the "d" which they know as "instantaneous" rate of change.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand how some of these students still haven't learned determinants if they're MIT students taking multivariable calculus........

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
38:46 not anymore ;)

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Power series starts at 22:45

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If the speed were non-unity say w, the relation would have come out to be root(2-2cos wt)...no biggie

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
En el minuto 3:08, dentro de la integral doble no debe decir "curl F" solamente (de ser así, esa sería una integral de flujo). Lo correcto es "(curl F)·n" donde n=(0,0,1) o "(curl F)·k", es decir, hacer el producto punto del rotacional del campo F con el vector normal al plano. Esa notación es mejor, puesto que es la que se usa después en el teorema de Stokes.

Mi punto es, no se realiza una integral de una función vectorial (Integral de flujo) sobre la superficie R, sino una integral de una función escalar, misma que proviene del producto punto del rotacional del campo (curl F) y el vector normal al plano: k.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Is this his first time?

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Awesome! I could watch the lectures over and over and each time, I gain a different and extra insight into the results and the process. Linear Algebra could turn into magic after you apply it’s theory—-the once dull computations of rows and columns. The most fascinating aspect of linear Algebra is when the entire matrix details unfold into a single effect, one that resembles the effect of simple scalars used in simple math formulas. Thanks to the fundamental concept of the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues. Understanding the very essence of a matrix and what it does to any vector quantity (change in magnitude and direction) is the key concept to appreciating the underlying concept of various matrix decompositions. It all boils down to how many ways we could see the workings of a matrix in terms of its decomposed forms. The SVD composition is one of those decompositions of a matrix that allows a matrix to be seen as a sequential transformation of direction and magnitude in terms of some orthonormal basis characteristic of such matrix and its Eigenspace. Such a beauty!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Best teacher I have ever seen.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Your work is appreciated Prof. Thank you very much.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Great lecture!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
im in victoria, school started last monday


### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
He made a monica lewensky joke in there, that cracked me up.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
What a smart and humble person! Long live Prof. Strang!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You can NOT define the derivative as the slope of the tangent line.  You have got it backwards.  The slope of the tangent line is equal to the value of the derivative, which value is defined by calculation.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I make the perfect brain

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Always got something great to listen to

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
at 14:18, the energy can also so be EQUAL to 0 (not JUST bigger than 0)! Then does this not mean that the matrix is positive SEMI definite as opposed to positive definite?

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Splendid lecture.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Although the lecture on determinants are great, in the beginning of math 18.06, DR. string seems disinterested in determinants. Determinants play an important part in solving linear equations.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
these lectures are excellent for indian students who learnt entire caclulus by byhearting formulas and now need to understand how everything works

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree, lovely teacher

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
Wow, watching the expected payout be equal for both x and y was exhilarating. Fantastic lecture

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
FRONZ!

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Free physics preview! My favorite!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Genius lecture .

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
being a maths major student, and lucky enough this course we are taking this semester, this is really helping me Dr.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thanks mit

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Very good explication !
Thanks from Italy 😊

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
The most amazing teacher

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Professor Strang said that the span of any vectors is the smallest subspace, I didnt quite get that. Would appreciate if anyone helps me on that regard, but nonetheless, this is a gem of a lecture, Thanks professor Strang.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i am 17 i and know hat the porf just all said hahah :P

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
david jerison

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
This guy has figured out how to access the 12 dimension. Infinite chalkboards; some crazy wizardry shit.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I would have applauded him at the end

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT you are doing a great job in  educating those who can't afford.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at the end he says that the limit is equal "1" so how that equials to e^1 !? doesn't it supposed to be e^0 ?

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
35:50

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
HAPPY  BDAY!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
GOAT Lectures as first course in probability

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am preparing to start an accelerated 1 month online single variable calculus class. Wish me luck.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
2) I felt (and again, this is my opinion), that he went too much into the intuition of the problem and not enough into the mechanics. I personally prefer to see the number crunching that goes on behind the scenes, and from there proceed to understand the holistic, intuitive story that's going on. Buzz words like "combination of columns" is too vague for me.

That being said, the lecture is freely distributed so I cannot complain. Thank you MIT for taking the time to make these videos.

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
44:40 the probability of x falling into the a interval is the integral of the density over this set

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
this vdos made me laugh when I reviewed

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
living legend  :-)

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why dont mit upload more new videos?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
English ❤️

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I know that, chief.  But the rest of the country calls it "Calc 1" or "Calc 2", and people pretty much know what it is.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this a lesson for the faculty of mathematics? 

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Love the Gilbert Strang ability to make linear algebra very illustrative and theorems so simple. One more time, thank you! )

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
the number of people watching this series decreases as the lecture progresses

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
The needle example is a great one that illustrates the usefulness of Statistics well :)

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks to dear Prof Denis and of course MIT, wow I have completed another course for MIT

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
The educational lead up to 40:07 "We really have discussed the most fundamental algorithm for a system of equations."

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 5:50 or so the student's question is why isn't [1/(b-a) * [integral from a to b] f(x)dx ] the average of F, not f, which is a good question.  Then he goes on to explain what an average is?  

Ironically I think the difference between a brilliantly effective professor and a very poor professor is minimal at MIT where the students are smart, because a brilliant professor challenges them legitimately and a poor professor requires them to self learn which ultimately are the same thing.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Could you add Lecture 10 and 16 from this year (2017)?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
tangent line? more like tangent lie

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You mean (x^2 + ax + b)^3?
The easiest way would be to factor it (which will always work if you know complex numbers).

Without factoring, you'll probably get a great mess.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Can anyone give me an example of a 'real-symmetric' matrix whose eigen value and singular value are not same...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
My puny mind can't handle this matrix exponential thing.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
am i right that the 2nd row should be (right at the beginning)
0 -2 2
and not
0 2 -2
and consequently the 2nd multiplier is -2 not 2 (or we can add instead of subtract) which leads to
0 0 -5
?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Its good they still use blackboards, significantly better and easier to follow than the bland powerpoints we seem to get at my uni..

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
damn it‘s hard

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice of world class.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The point is that the parabola has an intrinsic length specified by its shape.
This length is the diameter of the horizontal slice containing the focus of the parabola.
The formula for the volume of the paraboloid is actually:
(Pi a^2 k)/2
where k is the length in the parabola, therefore a volume is obtained and the units match up.
The slim cauldron has k=1cm and the fat cauldron has k=1m.
This is why the volume of the fat cauldron is 100 times bigger.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, brilliant explanation of Moment of Inertia, far better than I got in physics.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much MIT and to both professors who taught me Calc 1! I can't even put a price tag on what these videos will help me achieve.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Question is...

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
👏

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Learning the exact same thing as a high school senior

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I was with him right up until "Hi, this is the first lecture..."

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
learning linear algebra with you is like watching movies. it's fascinating, exciting, convincing and fun. thank you so much Professor Strang! Im so lucky to be learning this subject with you!

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
im a high school senior and i've known this =D

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ALL of the terms between N and 1, which I substituted for the endpoints b and a, sorry tht was confusing. anyway, all the terms between there cancel out. and were left with just the terms at the end. 

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Most glaring thing about raising trigfunctions in powers is that the reciprocal (-1) is used as showing arcus-functions eg. inverse trigs, not reciprocal.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Not just the United States:  there's at least one very good maths lecturer - Dr Chris Tisdell - operating out of University of New South Wales in Australia, and there are plenty from elsewhere, but the US does indeed have quite a nice slab of teaching vids out there.

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Who the hell is down-voting these videos? 😠

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]ha ha :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is my favorite professor

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He is explaining as though he is discovering the answers for the questions for the very first time. If that’s not intuitive, then I don’t know what is. In the future when I become a professor I want to teach like him.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was wondering if a semicircle is differentiable at x=+1. I would say no, since it becomes minus infinity.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
when finding an orthogonal vector, are there specific steps to find it, or do we have to find a vector (through inspection) which when multiplied by another vector through dot product is zero?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Statistics is replacing expectation with averages: frame it, get a tattoo, I don't care...
I'm sold.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
sort of like solving sudoku, like it.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good observation, In Portugal we learned it using the proof ot the squezze theorem, and that is the correct way. I am actually a mathematician. the intuitive aproach used in the lesson only had the benefit of spare the students the intrincacy of point set topology in its basic sense.


### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Saludos desde México! Excellent lectures

### 18. Markov Chains III
That's really helpful!! Thanks!!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]The union is not a subspace. The union is bigger than P or L so it definitely can't be a subspace of either of them. and by adding a vector from P with a vector from U you can get to a point that is neither in P nor in U or in other words by adding two points from P∪L you can get to points outside of P∪L (somewhere in R³). But to form a subspace you have to be able to add any vectors from that subspace and the result has to be in that subspace.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Eulers law is just beautiful ....

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys i am just confused guy from india
Is this video old or what i mean is this upto time?
I have studied all these during my jee preparation even i didn't get into IIT but remembered all these
Look anybody please

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Gilbert is really good at teasing the next lecture. I have to force myself to stop watching so I can sleep.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
he is the best professor i know

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Looks like Thomas Gore and Stephen Colbert merged into a mathematician.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Cover up method is common way that evaluate 2 constants and spent about 5 minutes long. But I use half cover up method to evaluate one constant and another constant by analysis, so it just spent about 10 seconds only. If professor interested it, I'd like share with you. I created many SC of PF, that let many PF from complicated getting to easier and simple.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much for your hard work.

### 7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars
For the acceptance problem for CFGs, why can't we make Da-cfg simulate the equivalent pushdown automaton of the CFG?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 20:29, why does x0-(x0+deltaX) simplify to -deltaX? Shouldn't x0 - x0 equal 0, and adding 0 to deltaX = deltaX?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
well explained, thank you very much professor

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
"A random variable is not random. It's not a variable. It's just a function from the sample space to the real numbers." Good stuff!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
This is for those people who don't know why the Permutations is 6 or 24 at the end. You should check out the Discrete Math 1 playlist on the youtube. 

You can also see my explanation if it helps you. Let's say there are 3 seats and 3 people. How many ways  of Permutations we can have. For the 1st person, there are 3 ways to letting him choose because there are three seats. After, the 1st person seated on of the 3 seats, there are two seats for the second person. so on... it will be 3 factor, which 3!. 3x2x1=6. You have 3 rows and 3 row operations, and this is just like the Permutations of 3 seats for 3 people.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Or five 9:32

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
is this for 1st year undergrad? O.o

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understund the laught at the end of the lecture. Seems like have appeared something in the board. I don't know. Perhaps is for my english. XD

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing professor'e last minutes made its count

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I'm a student in Ariel University at Israel. I'm studying computer science and math, and I just want to say that you are a terrific teacher!
I will recommend your lectures to my friends for sure!
Thank you a lot.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
easy. All they have to do is to have three lectures per week over perhaps 13 weeks (3 months) plus a bit more and you have 40. Yes that generally means that a freshman will have many hours of lectures per week across all subjects. Heavy workload.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
A work of art.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
My godness, stop moving the camera :<

### 3. Parametric Inference
Agreed, you will need some background in statistics and calculus to follow. But if you have the pre-requisites this is excellent

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you MIT and Gilbert Strang for the course. Very useful

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Only dummies will dislike this video

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Pauli Spin Matrices
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PauliMatrices.html

These are fun.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you sir for your lecture, why are we going to matrix form in order to solve equations

### 34. Final Course Review
The biggest takeaway from this class, besides how to guess the vector that makes the equations equal, is how to do math. Out of all of my math teachers, only Prof. Strang taught me this.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Everything ok sir it is being thought during my school but where to use or apply this maths in sceintific or commuter making softwares.

### 4. Counting
Great video. Must view video to understand Counting.. Thank you guys

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pretty easy material but I think the professor makes it harder than it really is. 

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
So much better than my prof

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love Story starts Just before General Strategy.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Someone said they didn't know the law of cosines, then there is another question, "how did they get into MIT?"

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you guys don't understand why ds/dt = |v|  i.e. the arc length thing, go watch the arc length videos from 18.01 Prof. Jerison explains it much much better.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great thnx from India!

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
This is my favorite lecture

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much MIT for these free lectures.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
....a huge lecture hall..but the instructor has to use chalkboard to write notes!!!

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
12:38 is it because regular language also CFL?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
A query, when Dr Strang, l assuming he has a PhD, expalains the row multiplication, isn't the resultant matrix a 1x3, so that its 1x row1, 2xrow2, 7xrow.. could someone clarify please.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
my left ear is pleased now

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
My left ear is finally being educated

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dont have money for book on amazon, how can i download it to solve the part 1 problem sets?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Is matrix mean different from E[estimator]? Because i didnt know you had to multiply by the number of samples

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I Really Like The Video Multiplication and Inverse Matrices From Your

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Very clear lecture. Awesome job.


### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
thank you

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
38:30

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
28:18

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
48:06  How does he know that the transformation matrix A must be a 2x3 matrix?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Gilbert Strang is too complicated.  Simply graph out the lines by the slope and y intercept method and see where they cross if they do.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have some small issue about the Jacobian. Why do we even need to take the absolute value of the determinant? In single variable case, the derivative can similarly be thought of as the "exchange rate" for the dx to du if we change variables and in the sense similar to the Jacobian but in there even if the detivative is negative we don't take absolute values. But why should we take absolute values in the Jacobian determinant case?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I switched from engineering to math/physics during college, and so was taught linear algebra with and without coordinates.  One course, entirely with matrices.  Another course almost entirely without matrices.  What a beautiful topic.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
47:20 see you mondy :)

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I'm so excited for this!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i enjoyed this seminar very much. from the very beginning there was a crescendo building towards the end where the climax had arrived and the meaning of e and ln were understood.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Check out math for computer science fall 2010 MIT operncourseware. Reading number 9, its gives a detailed explanation of this concept. As an aside "trust me i solved this problem in my physics class" isn't a proof :).

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
where is note? i cannot find. is it in https://ocw.mit.edu/18-065S18 ? he keeps mentioning about note that things he passed is in there

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is the answer in the probability task 5/32 ?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thx  Gilbert Strang and MIT for share this. Ok, ready for the trip! Lets goo

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
IF { he continues to write letters that big     AS he gives the lecture

THEN he's not gonna fit very much onto that blackboard.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
very helpful for self-study also.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is his name `?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Sir Gilbert Strang just blew my mind!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Second best part about watching these lectures is the comment section

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
25:10 it is NOT a toin coss

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
5:26, he said he is going to subtract, how is 3(2) - 8 = 2 and how is 3(1) - 1 = -2?? 

It should be -2 and 2 respectively 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It must be something students learn during their first year... the MIT is prestigious, it can't be that basic.. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
he is 70 here and has that hair

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
At 25:03 the row rank of the matrix can be found by converting the matrix A in echolon form. The reduced matrix will look like this
 1 0 1
 0 1 1
 0 0 0

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
When he uses those glasses he looks so kawai :3

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Wish I'd seen this earlier. Guess this is what I'll be doing with my summer!

### 14. Graph limits I: introduction
Thank you !!!!

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think he's actually not very sympathetic with students but he masters the subject and I find his explanations very enlightening, and hear him increases my knowledge and understanding a lot.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Simply excellent this professor is

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This cameraman... Stop zooming and show me the whole board instead.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good Job professor

### 8. Undecidability
Thank you 💞💞💞💞💞 ocw ocw

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The example is totally wrong. If the blocks are not stuck together the bottom block has not to be considered, as for the center of mass, and the max distance that can be reached is twice the length of a block.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
now doubt sir you are the blessing for mathematicians and also for related to this field,i often enjoy your lectures  in my vocations

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
"vectors from the space formed by independent eigen vectors of original matrix A == eigen  vectors themselves for some similar matrices to A (with same eigen values)"? Is this statement true or false? 42:24

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
F will have the same number of rows as I, but maybe not the same number of columns. So to make N, you just put -F on top and fill in the bottom with the identity matrix of the correct size (the number of columns of F). So say I is m by m and F is m by n, then N will have (m + n) rows and R will have (m + n) columns, so it works out. And each block multiplication (I * -F and F * I) also work out.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
perhaps prof jerison is dyslexic? he's a brilliant professor either way.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Let's take out a moment of Appreciation for the camera man👏👏

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
coughing

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Truly awesome instructor. Fantastic!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]calling the students "those idiots" is pushing it. You have to know a little bit more than just "getting a first intro lecture" to get into MIT. :)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I can see in the class of this excellent professor and mathematician what the real problem in mathematical education is: our obsession to cover the topics always skips the necessity of the students to form the proper intuition of a topic. Intuition takes time, but above all takes proper activities to develop it. His talk is basically about the generation of spaces through linear combinations, but honestly could anyone sitting down there and listening reproduce those ideas without the help of proper representations, say, software, or at least good pictures? In mathematics, physics etc, intuition is the most important, but scholastic education has always tortured them with logic. That is totally unfair and a waste of talented students.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
I think B_j should be A transpose replaced by b 24:16

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:22 felt like teleportation :D

### 34. Final Course Review
It's like I have learned the philosophy of linear algebra, and now my conscience is at a higher state. I had such a great time. Thank you sir 🙏. Thank you ocw👍.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
1:49 Sometimes I watch his classes several times to make things settle in my mind, but sometimes just because I want to enjoy the humor.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
11:26 Thinking back to last lecture
if the first pivot was a 0
then the first and 3rd equations would be on the same plane 
and then there wouldnt be a b value for every point on the Row graph?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
His book seams very good as well.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Thank you Professor Gilbert Strang for your awesome presentation ,  got inspired to be faculty.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Hope we become neighbors in heaven Mr Strang.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Hats off!! thanks prof. Strang.

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Why the Total Variation distance between P theta and P theta prime is one half of the sum? Where this one half comes from? (Min 42:32)

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
At 49:30 can someone please explain me how in matrix -b and -k came, I tried hard but couldn't understood, or am I missing some sort of pre requisite here?

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor is great... Camera man sucks. I need to watch the chalk board.. Not the professor.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
this man is great teacher every lecture he did is really a great piece of Art

I'm so happy to see you here. I only trust you when it comes to lecture

### Lec 32 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've noticed them since I've watched the 4th lecture ..I think its some sort of computer generated comments someone at MIT is using. But to whaat end m not sure. Creepy shit

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
confusing name of the lecture.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
As an avid Rick and Morty fan (200 IQ.) i thought id visit calculus videos to see if the profs were doing a good job.

### 14. Poisson Process I
51:46 he probably meant "this plus that" instead of "this plus that".

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
great lecture

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
@[USERNAME]Karamazov lol you are so right lol

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
could I go through this course without watching the linear algebra course?
Or should I start with linear algebra first?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
25:56  "I'm a happier person now." I love his interludes. Thank you, professor, a lot.

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
It is very nice activity to learn from an old man as Strang. Thank very much Prof. Strang for  all services such as your physical energy, your smartbrain  and sacrifice. By  watching these videos, I learn a lot things and I decide to follow Prof. Strang.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
People from all around the globe is covering the intellectual need of USA.
  

### 34. Final Course Review
der bass muss ficken

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
37:40 Wrong assumption, one of the lengths of the vectors can be 0, in which case angle isn't defined and even though it's perpendicular(by definition of euclidean spaces if I remember correctly) you can't deduce cos theta is 0 from that.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What took MIT so long to post past Lecture 12. Thank for the recent uploads MIT, but don't slack on us now, please post the other Single Variable Courses IMMEDIATELY. I love these videos.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I feel that Khan Academy's way of explaining double integral seems clearer to me

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
37:18   
That's what she said

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
well I don't think A' has an inverse. so you can't backtrack from eq 2 to eq 1

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Excelent!! :P

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Excelent...

### Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras
An abbreviation is a shortening of a word or a phrase. An acronym is an abbreviation that forms a word. An initialism is an abbreviation that uses the first letter of each word in the phrase (thus, some but not all initialisms are acronyms).

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
professor was wrong on solving function (3x-x exp 3) at time 38 and above

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I'm new to math but isn't Euler's formula e^ix = cosx + isinx,
I can't see how the equations with nodes and edges relate to the formula..

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
A healthy society uses the generated wealth to improve itself, to improve the living standards, the education people gets, etc.. but your society is a sick one, and sadly that sickness is spreading everywhere as mcdonalds did, stop being such fools and wake up, you don't have middle class anymore, middle class is by definition people who can afford a more or less normal life WITHOUT being heavily indebted and being slaves of that debt. 

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he has very neat hand writing.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
its at 15:25 actually

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]nope, maybe a bit too late but he did mean tangent. take a look at the first example he did ~18mins. The vector field is parallel to the normal but the answer isn't zero.
and any 2 perpendicular vector dot each other would give zero, so that should explain 14:27 as well

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
Test

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
21:52

### 16. Markov Chains I
I like how well he is trying to give us those intuitions

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Beautiful lecture, just beautiful. Prof. Strang is drawing the beauty of Linear Algebra on a blackboard.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
if the gods give everyone a boost of 10cm... lolll we have a true champ here.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Just I have wondered. Are they student of MIT? Why are they so silent??????

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
True I remember learning this in 9th grade in algebra 2. Didn't learn cross product or having to compute det/inv of 3x3 matrix

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I used Professor Strang's Linear Algebra book in 1981.  I wish there a way to ask the questions I have about the material.  There's one question in particular that I have that keeps bugging me.  If anyone knows how and where I can ask my question, please let me know.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"unless you have one of those fancy cars with the GPS" - this lecture will be funny in some years

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished 18.01. Thank you so much, Prof. Jerison and MIT OCW for this gift to the world. Manila, Philippines (2020/03/08)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Is the sound echoing because the prof is teaching in god mode?

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I laughed out loud at the corn field metaphor

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
I know that chalk...

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]dude it doesn't matter, most likely if you go to MIT, you're going to be making a ton of money.
A ton of money=Unlimited women

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Brilliant

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Can the ideas of linear approximation be extended infinitely to develop the taylor series for e^x and sin(x) and cos(x)?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Is it me or lectures are getting tougher day by day

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
O wold like to know the MIT’S Building o the buildin school.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you Professor Auroux for your teaching, and MIT OCW for making this available! I really enjoyed this class. Now I'm ready for 18.03, 8.01, and 8.02 :).

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy can teach. He is not pretentious, and is not afraid to explain the algebra behind the calculations. I remember my freshman calculus course. If you forgot any of the algebra basics there was a lot of uncomfortable silence.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
what's the diference between this course and 6.041? if i try to understand 18.650 wich of them should i see?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
People like Gilbert Strang are a gift for the entire world. They advance the progress of civilizatio by hundreds of years in their lifetime through sheer dedication and genius, while being humble enough to impart that vast amount of knowledge to students in a lingo that they understand.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you sir

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]in italy we do that in highschool...and i did that in highschool too while i was in the US... i guess it just depends... but if it's a beginning class..maybe it's better to start from the beginning.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That dora cake tho..

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
is he french? his accent is so funny

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Where did he use in the proof of the calculation formula for directional derivative that u must be unit vector? Thank you

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this really MIT? sin (a + b) = sin a . cos b.... REALLY????

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
"I'm coming" - Mr. Cognitive Decline
"Not today" - Dr. Strang

### Lec 28 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
When taping a lecture, keep the camera on the board, not the professor. Lesson of the day.


### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank you Gilbert Strang. I remember when I was an undergraduate in 2010 and studying linear algebra. I didn't understand anything going on, and found your videos on MIT open courseware. Not only did you get me to understand linear algebra, but your lectures sparked my interest in math. I decided to become a math major after the course. Now it is 12 years later and I am again taking a matrix theory course for my part time graduate degree and again are using your videos. Thank you again for everything you have done for us, people who never stepped foot on MIT. Your impact on the world is enormous and your contributions should be appreciated!

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
close packing order with density as a function of particle in 3 dimensional space is my forte. nice example

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Exellent work by the Prof... for those like ME who are LOST...This can help clarify a bit : https://youtu.be/KsqmAJ7Qyf8

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks a million professor Strang and thank you MIT for your generosity. God bless. I'll be taking this course in July and i'm confident of passing.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Linear Algebra = Useless fake math in the dream world.
Pre-calc + Calc = real life math. 

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lecture! Thx

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ƒ'(x) isn't Newton's notation. It's Lagrange's.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very good lecture, thanks professor

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
33:28

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT OCW, I believe there are a couple typos in the copy of the Unit 4 Exam included on the course website, as the problems given differ from those to which the answer is given in the solutions sheet, specifically for problems #3 and #6a on aforementioned Unit 4 examination.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yay! I just finished this in school holiday! (my single most productive holiday ever) But ouch I havent taken the final exam yet :s

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]nvm it was in the next lesson :p 
sry about that

### 20. Central Limit Theorem
Excellent Prof!!! ElGrecoProf++

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I think I am too lazy to use this. Probably will just use mv calculus. Great subject anyway and a very nice intuition to have.

### 34. Final Course Review
한 걸음 내딛을 때마다 지식만이 아니라 흥미까지 차오르는 강의였습니다. 한 학기 동안 정말 감사했습니다, 스트랭 교수님.

Not only were these lectures intellectually pleasing, but they also showed me the beauty of linear algebra itself. Thank you again, Professor Strang.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can t understand the binomial expansion

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Wow, super clear! Really enjoy the lecture

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is just an introductory course to make sure everyone has the exact same foundation for more difficult courses later on. Keep in mind that this is also known as Calculus I and every university, from the smallest to biggest, teaches the same basics as everyone else.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
can anyone provide me notes

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How is it possible that some people were taking this course on MIT and still didn't know about the law of cossines or even vector addition???

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Damn his handwriting is very pretty

### 4. Counting
.' .░░░💕*so much thankful to M.I.T and you all kindness; beautiful courses.'

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what a smart camera man!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
A toin coss😂

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
which books do they follow??

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]He subtracted 3 x row 1 "from "row 2. That is 8 - 3(2)  = 2; 1 - 3(1) = -2. 

An easier way to think about it instead is multiply row 1 by -3 and add it to row 2. People find it easier to add instead of subtract when negative numbers come haha. 

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Second: If we take “a” as the height of the figure, then the equation would be V= (pi/2)h*a, (remember that height is NOT unit squared). We could also write “a” as “x”(or radius) squared, so the final equation would be V=(pi/2)h*r^2 which won’t have any problem with units. I hope I made myself clear.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Thank you MIT for enabling us enjoy these treats.. And Prof. Strang is just pure genius

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I love these lectures

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Love you Professor. You are such an adorable person and a great great teacher!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]This is just my guess, but I imagine this course is geared towards engineering and science majors at MIT, not math majors. Or at least I hope! Because I goto a small liberal arts college no one has ever heard of, and my linear algebra course was much more rigorous than this. All theory and proofs. No applications. Which I didn't mind. :)

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:30 is the time when they should applaud. They didn't!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
oh.my.god. he is just TOO PRECIOUS!!!!!
every time he starts with his way too excited "OK!" I actually get excited too :)
Thanks Dr. Strang!

In math doesn't exist a geometric proof

### 34. Final Course Review
tq MIT and  G.Strang

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
I bought the book Linear Algebra and Learning from Data, it is used as the course notes for the course series . I could borrow it from my university library for free, but I really think it is a book worth keeping and I want to show my respect to Dr. Strang for sharing his wisdom selflessly, thank you professor.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
I think we can assume the probability of individual points in continuous sample space as epsilon which is infinitely small but when add it turns out to be 1 without sacrificing the math/probability

### 4. Counting
at 47:53 omg left bottom corner: hooded "A" taking a class at MIT! that explains everything!

### 34. Final Course Review

Nice shirt!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT. Really useful for me, my team of teachers and students. We are not only learning calculus but also how to teach it to our kids. Prof is down to earth, humble and going to great length explaining the topic. I have a new perspective on teaching after viewing these five lectures. Thanks again!!!!!! You're transforming lives.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Arre kehna kya chahte ho

I am in 8 standard but i learn whole calculus through mit lectures

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Final review.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
What textbook do they use for MIT calculus?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is great. This guy is soo much better than my teacher and much more enthusiastic.

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
👍👏👍👏👍

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This is Calc 2. Your argument is invalid.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Will we have later in the course any explanation of the 9 dimensions example? I didn't get it well although he's a master, a great Professor really.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
MIT, thanks you!

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone realise that he sometimes try to add humour to his lectures?

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Every time he says 'i claim' I say thanks MIT for such beautiful lectures from a great teacher 

### Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers
I can not admit he is a good teacher.

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand hexadecimal and F... the rest.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
its a pitty that he didnt explained what happens above two (independent) variables, since you cant use the second derivatives test there.

there's a method involving taylor polynomial but i didnt get it well from the book

thanks anyways, these videos are REALLY usefull for donkeys reading math books like me.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing professor

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Two methods can be used to calculate the total resistance of the parallel circuit. They are the Product Over Sum equation or the Reciprocal Formula. Sumequation as we only have two parallel resistors. Theparallel resistors must be reduced to a single series value before being added to the series resistor.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
when this lecture was recorded?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
HE JUST MADE ME TO GO IN INEPTION OG THOUGHTS WHILE TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICAL NINE DIMENSIONS THEN IN THE END HE JUST MADE IT PUFFF GO AWAY

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I wish i knew this lectures before my midterm 1. I hope I will be recover my grades for mt2 and final. Thanks a lot!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Perfect revision after almost 30 years ! thank you .

### 34. Final Course Review
Professor Strang!! Wooow, no wonder that MIT is the best, this guy is the best teacher ever found... 
I wish we had more of Professor Strang!!!!
Thank you very much Sir, your the best :)) 

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
The class is empty, but Gilbert Strang's passion is full...

### 4. Counting
Thanks prof. John Tsitsiklis and mit to share the knowledge to the whole world 
Sorry about my language, not native speaker.

### 34. Final Course Review
Mr strang is the  best thing ever happened to humanity!!!

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
Thanks!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I'm studying in McGill and this man is saving lives. Ofc, cramming before the finals :D God bless this man. Watched his videos on 1.25x speed

### 34. Final Course Review
Went thru it one time, today thru the couse again and take my own notes. Prof Strang is a sooooo great!!!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Los subtítulos en inglés son muy útiles para los que tenemos un dominio parcial de su idioma =)

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I got a little bit confused about the definition of Taylor Formula. It seems that what Prof. Jerison has written is Maclaurin Series, which is a special case of the Taylor Series. And is there any difference between Taylor formula and Taylor Series? If you translate them directly to Chinese (My mother tongue:P) there are some differences. I got stuck in this point, hope someone can help me out, tks:).

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Is there a practical use to matrix diagonalization, or is it just a cool trick like 3 balls Mill's mess or sword swallowing ?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Gilbert Strang lecture: "and this is a matrix..."
Gilbert Strang textbook: "Find the corners of a square in n dimensions and whether vectors a, s, d,e w,wieidwdjdkdk are contained in the cube...."

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
5:00 I would definitely use Support Vector Machine

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
The Lecture has become immortal, sir! Thank you!
(Ref - first sentence of Prof. Strang in the lecture)

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The natural log explanation (21-27:~) was absolutely fantastic!!!


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oops. At 7:45 he said prime without referring to ribs. What part of YouTube did I just end up in?? I'll keep watching but there better not be a jump scare later.  jk.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Going to MIT has been a dream of mine for a long time and thanks to these videos I can fulfill these dreams. 
I'm incredibly greatful for all the open courseware MIT offers me and the whole world.
Thank you.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice board work and excellent lecture.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This course is great. But there are also khanacademy calculus videos, they are great too.

### Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value
im using this as prep for my real analysis class next quarter at UCLA. Using winter break to my advantage ;)
I will learn all of real analysis before the class even starts lol

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Upto 19:00 Row operation elimination and back substituton(row eschelon form)

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This class is brighter than calculus class

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
An excellent lecturer. I'm growing less fond of the students in the audience, who seem easily amused by random occurrences, are obsessed with whether a concept is going to be on the exam rather than being interested in learning for its own sake, and they repeatedly joke/complain about the difficulty of Taylor's series, even though for someone who got into MIT that should be elementary.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is best lecture everrr

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is the best explanation of the projection formula that I have ever seen. Prof. Strang not only provides a mathematical basis of the formula by deriving it, but also provides clear intuition and motivation. He also takes the time to go through the simpler case of projecting onto a line first, which allows building up the understanding of the content gradually. What a great lecture!

This is another brilliant lecture  on column and row space. These topics are very important in linear algebra for current and future learning.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Dude needs better erasers

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]the lectures that are uploaded from MIT are pretty informing (and helpful) whether you think professors are idiots or not. And an advice , being arrogant is not a bad thing , being arrogant with nothing extraordinary to prove extraordinary claims gives other people a good reason to think that you are also an idiot. 

@[USERNAME]you say you are both smart , but your conversation was not intellectual at all

have a nice day :)

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
ty for lectures

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I am confused...  For R²  subspaces are
1 origin
2 line itself... Alright upto here
But last one is it's any line through origin or something else

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished the course - what a wonderful series of lectures! Thank you so much Professor Auroux and MIT OCW!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Which algebra course do you think is better, this one or the one Gilbert took in 2005?
PS: Of course both must be great. 
Thank you

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love the nerdy comments on youtube... make me feel like home

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Today I have finished this course. I just wanna say Prof. David Jerison is an excellent and extraordinary teacher.  
Bundle of thanks for those who have made this possible to bring this course online and make it available to everyone for free.
Thank you very much MIT...

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get the final table he made. What is (sqrt(5) - Xn) ?


P.S It's the error analysis. I got from the next lecture.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
We love you

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy must drink a lot of coffee before class lol 

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Seemed sooo difficult in class today......now i understand why they are so good at MIT. Such a great teacher....Make it look easy. 

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Protect him at all costs! 🥺

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
"don't all speak at once" is he joking, or trying to hide the fact that the class is empty? not sure yet :)

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
At 43:22 why did we not consider the bigger loops?

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i was completely lost for 2 whole days trying to make intuitive sense of it after my college professor taught us this. I mean i only got taught the algorithm for finding the jacobian but not what it actually is but after watching this, it finally clicked and i am so happy lmao

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Wow

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:18 Peek A BOO!

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Wow , Wow ! What an amazing explanation ... i felt like Multivariate Calculus is very easy as opposite of usual

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is a silly question, but making me curious. How does the chalk board always remain clean for the professors to write. I love chalk boards, but thought it is messy to clean !! ? His writing is excellent, and his presentation is SUPER ! Thanks a lot.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Khan gives a shallow explanation and explains rather easy problems...He's pretty good at helping with some intuition, but these courses are WAY more complete. 

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
His proof on sine theta/theta is classical. Love it!

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
35:17 Fourier Series

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is the slope of the pyramid 1/2

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
sometimes they are extremely hard, we had one that was almost unsolvable in our exam

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you'd think MIT would have invented an automatic board erasing device by then.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
At around the 21 minute mark, he says that it’s too much to hope for to reduce the matrix A0 to an upper triangular matrix. He immediately follows up with a statement that it’s impossible to solve a 5x5 system with simple steps. And this is why you instead reduce A0 to an upper Hessenberg matrix instead.

I got lost trying to follow this argument, so I did a bit of research.  Can someone tell me if I've got it right:
1) The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are just its diagonal elements.
2) The Abel-Ruffini theorem says that's impossible, using radicals, to find the roots of a 5th order polynomial.
3) If you were to try to solve det(A - lambda I) = 0 for a  5x5 triangular matrix, you'd be trying to find the roots of a 5th order polynomial. Though doesn't it automatically come perfectly factored for you to read off the eigenvalues?

Combining all of these, does the Abel-Ruffini theorem imply that you can't transform a 5x5 matrix into triangular form via orthogonal transformations (e.g. Householder reflections) which preserve the eigenvalues?  This doesn't sit right with me, so I'm thinking that can't be it.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The way he arrived at the Identity Matrix.. So ingenius !!
Never thought of it that way

Edit: And he explained inverses BEAUTIFULLY !!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Why wouldn't the error be the perpendicular distance to the line? in the video, the prof said it to be the vertical distance to the line.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
This lecture is such a sad story for those who never understood electrical engineering basics like me. It could have gotten a lot better if he stuck to those friendships and Internet applications he mentioned in the last lecture.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
That moment you need to learn math to play ff14...

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:03 "then you will either enjoy yourself" did I hear what I thought I hear? /facepalm

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
wow hes old now....

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I love this prof. Thank you

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
I like more the A(i,j)*-1^(i+j)*C(i,j) form

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
no white boards there?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mathematics has to be the most boring subject, idk why im watchin this but MrdeathMental's comment is fuckin hilarious

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Is it just me or is the quality of the video progressively getting worse?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Finally i know what determinants is . i want to cry

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
I thought that the projection of the points onto the line ("error") was meant to be perpendicular to the line, and not a projection in the y-axis.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
There are no students sitting there, but the lecture is still so good.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Holy shit! The legendary Michael Sipser is teaching it in video!!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How do i integrate , (Cos√x)/Sinx

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
22:00

25:20

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This discussion has an application for the quantum sciences.  The quantum Hall spin-polarized effect has subatomic particles translations through crystalline structures in arbitrary space.  This has an epic important for finding new medical, electronics, energy, and other devices that will change our world.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Somehow I have the feeling Professor is making it very difficult in this lecture and assume students to have already done some deep courses on Linear Aljebra!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
so substitute infinity  minus one and chart the resultant here and now on the time line relax allow the unknown as infinite as well same graph pulse the fibronchi generator chart for rms the rms positive on sine only so return to chart and now condense the univariable into quantum  zero

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
IT FINALLY MAKES SENSE my god i feel like crying what an incredible teacher

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not fighting anything. The comment you replied to here itself refers to a comment that a) was removed b) a syntactical failure c) needlessly abrasive and d) factually incorrect.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The comments are edu canned laughter,not as smart as they need!!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thank You Sir

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think that's because he's calculating how many blocks you need to have hanging over the edge of the first one. That would let him not count it in the calculation.

### 34. Final Course Review
today i completed the course!!
my last 34 days were like i was in heaven!!! 
i had tears in my eyes at the last moment. i want to study all my life.
thank you for inspiring me.
I'll work hard . you have ignited me thank you for providing acceleration to my life.
can't describe the feeling in the words.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is d/dx ln(x)=x'/x?

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Watching this after learning my times 6 times table 😂

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Conclusion: Four fundamental subspaces of A(m*n), including 1. The column space means spanning the column vectors, which is in R to m, notation as C(A)
2. The nullspace of A means the free variables corresponding vector span the null space, which is in R to n, notation as N(A)
3. The row space means spanning the row vectors, which is in R to n, notation as C(A') equal to n-r
4. The left nullspace of A means the A' free variables corresponding vector span the null space, which is in R to m, notation as N(A') equal to m-r.
other conclusions: The sum of dim(C(A')) and N(A) is equal to n, the sum of dim(C(A)) and N(A') is equal to m.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Should i already have experience with proof writing?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why everyone clapped at 43:25?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Why I-P at 8:22?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Why do we have e = b - p and not, e = sqrt(b^2 - p^2) ?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I've been watching all the lectures till know and I intend to watch the rest,

thanks to the professor and to the sponsor for making such wonderful world-class education available to anyone.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm in the UK and i've taken this not even in my final year of high school, but bear in mind, this class is for people NOT taking maths, it's for other majors who have to take it. Also i really doubt you covered it at the pace of these lectures (the whole of elementary single variable calculus in a term).

Great video

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Just finished Single Variable Calculus course. 
Thanks to MIT for this opportunity. Prof. David Jerison is the best math teacher I ever had.
Kazakhstan, 2022

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you have kassabov?

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
His sniffling is making me sniffle

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
(In such texts, students also are told that that they MUST NOT say that a matrix A is equal to a matrix B when B does not have exactly the same number of columns as A.)  The use of the notation "R^3" for the space of real (3x1) matrices (aka (3x1) column vectors) requires one to accept a conflation of three DIFFERENT KINDS of real vectors with three entries, 3-tuples of real numbers, row vectors with exactly three real entries, and column vectors with exactly three real entries.  (2 B continued)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
After so many years of using linear algebra, until today I finally understand the meaning of matrix multiplication.  matrix*vector is linear combination of the columns of the matrix, and vector*matrix is linear combination of the row of the matrix. Then from this standpoint, the meaning of permutation matrix becomes so obvious. Thank you Prof. Strang.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
At first i thought his book was meant to be cryptic, now it makes sense...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
ignorance is bliss. at least for me it is.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ideally, do you learn multivariable calculus first or linear algebra? A lot of stuff here seems to be based on 18.06.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i am currently engineering first year . after i get a job i will definetely donate to mit ocw

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
No matter how artificial and "strange" matrices look, they are always derived from very simple reasonings.
In fact, you can quite easily derive the technicalities behind the determinant matrix operations, cofactor expansions etc simply by playing around with row reductions etc and experiment a bit.
I managed to derive the cross product even before I read the definition behind it, because I love figuring things out like that.

One major advantage in knowing the theory behind these things is that you don't need to "look it up", because since you know how it works you can simply derive it on the spot.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Where can we find the notes professor Strang mentions in the videos? ( 45:17 )

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Stanford also posts its lectures on YouTube

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Honourable MIT, COULD YOU PLEASE ALSO TELL US THE TIME FOR EXAM 1(LEC 8)?

THANKS

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]

Computers are one of the main reasons people don't understand how to do arithmatic.

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Possibly, but not necessarily. It could be positive, zero, and then back to positive like in y=x^3.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hey in defining slope why we should take delta x tends to zero because for the point Q to be P it is both delta x and y both should be zero right??

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How can he compare sum of areas to volume? Its better if we use n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6 to represent the sum of n^2 terms and compare it with other two terms.

which is why you were reviewing your calculas just a year ago.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i highly recommend this video for those who have an idea of calculus

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
at 26:13  I dont get how he can switch column 2 and column 3 to get the identity matrix in the first block of [ I F] ? You cant chage the order of pivot columns just like that ? PLEASE answer this for me someone! 1love

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Salute and pranam to this great legend...I hope he lives till eternity

F R E N C H B O I

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]sorry but that's what most ppl can do :)

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
6 more lectures to go, let's finish strong. 

for those interested in following the course or learning the material more deeply, I've personally just been doing problems from the book rather than the OCW page (most of the problem sets are from the book anyway, not sure about the exams). I recommend looking through the problems because I find that they show different ways of applying the concepts and help develop problem-solving intuition. If you're like me and coming from a very non-mathematical background, I think putting in a lot of time (10+ h/week) to learn the material well is a very worthwhile endeavour, if you can afford it.

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In case you are wondering: the third root of 64.1 is about 4.0020822.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Brilliant, brilliant lecturer.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Before I went to grad school in the summer of 2015 I watched Dr. Strang's entire 18.06 course to make sure I was prepared. Now, five years later, PhD in hand, I still learn something every time I watch him speak.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]or Quebec or Ontario..

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
After thirty years of 3D computing high education is still done manually all over the world. Ironically, universities are the most opposed to change. It's embarrassing.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best question at 26:30.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Opurem

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
I enjoyed this lecture on Similar Matrices and Jordan Form as part of linear algebra. Once again DR. Strang  showed the application of both topics with examples.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
for 2 by 2 systems the normal method at school is fine but it's too long and it's much quicker to write it in a matrix and the pivots and words like that are just terms to describe what he is doing

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
모든 MIT 강의가 이럴 것이라고 생각하지는 않지만 연세가 80 가량인 노교수가 자신의 머리 속 생각을 투명하게 펼쳐보이며 수백 번은 이미 강의하셨을 내용을 생생하고도 열정적으로 학생들에게 마치 처음 설명하시는 것처럼 전달하시는 것을 보며 충격을 받습니다. 과잉 일반화하는 것일 수 있고 혹자에게는 편협하고도 부당한 평가로 폄하될 수 있을 말이지만 용기내 볼멘 소리를 하자면 한국 대학은 과연 대학이라는 정의에 포섭이라도 되고 있는 것일까 회의를 하게 된다는 것입니다. 60만 넘어도 무슨 대가라도 되서 강의조차 초탈하게 대해버리며 정부나 삼성만을 바라는, 학생들에게 많은 고통을 주는 많은 이 땅의 학자연하는 자들에게 이 강의를 보여주고 싶습니다.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Funnily enough, my linear algebra courses drilled the column picture into my head so hard that I completely forgot about the row picture. I kept wondering how we did all this fancy geometry with planes in school when solutions obviously represent vectors that get mapped to a certain vector, and matrices represent transformations of space. I hope the row picture comes up sometimes so I can redevelop that intuition.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I just love math. ^-^

### 3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
the quality is so low

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
i recommend first than 3Blue1Brown and this classes try to take a zoom into C.Lay book... that visión can understand much better this video

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Could someone give me a clue why use A(T)AX(hat)=A(T)b to solve [C,D] at 21:05 ? To my understanding, AX(hat) cannot be b if we fit a line which points are P1, P2, P3 instead of b1, b2, b3 or [1 2 2]_t?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
great professor, He is really teaching something compared with my professor who only knows repeating the textbook.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Awesome video. Using it to get ahead for fall!  Thank you for providing this to the public. In the age of the internet, knowledge is as cheap as the wifi!

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where can I find the detail solutions of other problem set ???

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
What happens when the eigenvalues are complex?  It doesn't seem like the QR method would converge as all the numbers resulting from this method would be real.

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
Thank you so much ! But what if x and y (the observation) are continuous ?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I saw something, that i have never seen before .

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
"the apparition just wanted to be sure that we got the right answer.."  MIT is super cool XD

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I hope that'll help me pass my linear algebra exam

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What kind of chalk is being used?     And what is the stick diameter? 

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not sure why I'm even watching this, but in the beginning, the professor dotted an e. :P

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
He is a legend!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This course helps me a lot. Thank you, MIT!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Complete waste of time

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
A question: Did you guys study this in your highschool too?

### 34. Final Course Review
I'm a physics student and we take a lot of linear algebra classes. The lectures and the literature we get is, for me, just gibberish because our professor rarely dares to step out of the comfort zone and teach linear algebra in such an intuitive way like Prof. Gilbert Strang does. These lectures helped me so much and they're an underlying reason why I can not only understand the basics of linear algebra now, but appreciate the beauty of it too. Thank you, Professor. 

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Genius!

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why did he plug the values of Qo in the equation (x+2y+4z) it does not make  any sense !

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers

Least square approximation

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
He says 'This guy' when referring to a vector. God help his students......

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Im just gonna write this for ppl like me 

if you are like me(didn't finish high school yet(first year)) you will have to put some effort in studying this u gotta search for some basics u may not have been taught yet and it will take a lot of time to search alot but just try and take the reason you are studying this that early as a motivation cuaze some stuff will be so frustrating and hard to understand cuaze u haven't mastered some basics yet but ik for sure it's worth 

for me Im studying this to learn machine learning and some stuff i wanna also do physics engines and stuff like that to help people and i found that everything i wanna do is related to linear algebra and once i get it and get deep into it i can do whatever i want just by some basic research 

Trust me it's hard but worth❤

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
A mathematician with Great sense of Humour. Mr. Strang !

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Can anyone tell me what was the purpose of giving '0' and '1' to free variables in order? Thank you!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
cool lecture!!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
because to use the 2nd der. test you need a critical point. In the types of problems with constraints, min/max is not necessarily a critical point.

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Exam 3 review

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I studied this and used it all my life, but I never learned the “column” view.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
What book is Gilbert sir following? Can anyone give the name? I am from India about to pursue my masters and I need this course

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Best teacher

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Started this course on OCW and it is just brilliant, it gives an intuitive sense to concepts I learned a long time ago but which were conveyed in a much drier way. thanks !!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can someone suggest to me a lecture series that is mended for beginners I want to start calculus

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
I have huge respect for this lecture series and Professor Strang. This exact syllabus is what we have to learn in 2020 as one of our core courses in  CSE MS in AI/Robotics and ML. It is going to take multiple revisions to really internalize all that this lecture series has to offer. Professor, I hope to build some good things and help usher in the AI revolution that is happening. Thank you for sharing your knowledge to us, the next generation to push things a little bit more into the future.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Very nice explanation. From now I am a big fan of him

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Mr. Strang! Ahahaha so nice at 43:10

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
2 months and nobody comments! D:

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
An Excellent lecture thank you

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Well the people who came into the lecture late said they were from physics....

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
very nice!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
my teacher made me think i hated linear algebra ..... but i dont think i do anymore ... i want this guy around in the physics lounge to teach me his ways  

### Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points
At 39:55, the professor multiply [A  S-1] to the left side of [S  AT; A  0] to get [S  AT; 0  -A*S-1*AT]. Can anybody please explain the purpose of this calculation ? Thanks in advance!

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
No, I don't think so.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
39:52 Gauss would quit, but Jordan says keep going.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
when the love child of mr rogers and bill nye decides to teach algebra

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
The first two eigenvalues are 0 and 2 which correspond to the eigenvectors (1,1,1,1), (0,0,-1,1). He says some of the components in this second eigenvectors are positive and some are negative which tells you which cluster each node is in. But he never carries it out and explain the 0 components? See wolfram-alpha https://tinyurl.com/y7vdkhua for decomposition.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Taking notes on this class using mostly screen captures!  Very useable boardwork

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Salute this man, he has taught more students linear algebra than anyone in history, and is likely to continue to do so eternally!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The logic behind his teaching is pretty coherent and well - organized.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
Why this bullshit bicycle in the classroom?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So big chalk..

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wonder why do we need to differentiate a function just to find the slope between two x values
whereby x is acted as parameter to the function f(x)..
We can find gradient by simply do
f(x)-f(x-1)
so this guarentee over one unit of x you get gradient..
Also it does not make sense to find gradient between two units of x..
For example consider f(x)=x²
to find gradient simply do
f(5)-f(4)
or anything like that as long it is f(x)-f(x-1)..
In this example we will get 25-16=9
So the gradient of the tangent line that intersects x=4 and x=5 is 9..
If you use differentiation f'(x)=2x+c
Let say you neglect c for a second..
And plug into the formula
At f'(5)=2(5)
Which is equivalent to 10
But this is incorrect..the correct value is 9
so now we know c=-dx
So if you want to find gradient between two units of x you get c=-2
which means f'(x)=2x-2
So I don't think finding the gradient between two units of x is relevant and so why not just use f(x)-f(x-1)
to find the gradient when x only incremented by one unit not more and not less

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
47:09, what would the sample space in terms of area look like for the coin flip of heads for the first time? How would you present an infinite area?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I love the quirky teaching style of Prof. Strang, especially how he feigns to encounter something surprising, whereas in fact it is well-rehearsed.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
I don't get the point of A = LU.  You need to know U to solve for x in Ax=b.  You need E to find U, you can't get U from L.  Once you have U, you're basically done.  What do you need L for?

I understand the point that L is less costly than E -- but what use is L if you don't know U yet?    What am I missing?

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's been a long day without you my friend. I will tell you all about it when I see you again.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are you kidding me that this university is at the top of the ranking of all the universities around the world considering mathematics and my university doesn't even appear there? We learned many more things, we did very strict definitions, theorems, proofs (one proof could have taken an hour!), our lectures lasted for one and a half hour twice a week and we did three parts of Calculus during one and a half year! And yes, we did it from the first semester of the first year - undergraduate. This is what you teach future mathematicians at "the best university of the world"? Here, where I live, such courses are destined for future chemists or engineers but surely not for mathematicians... How's it possible that you're at the first place and we even don't appear in topuniversities?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
wow, this lecture has opened my eyes. Thank you, professor Strang!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
thanks for this lectures

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
W. O. W. Nuff said.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Professor Strang is one of the best out there, you can have all the knowledge and skills for mathematics but some teachers, no matter how passionate or smart, are really bad. There is something about the way Professor Strang explains things which makes everything more understandable and interesting. 
I'm using Howard Anton's book at school + my teacher is THE WORST. Linear Algebra had been a nightmare up to the point where i found these videos.
 If i ever meet Professor Strang I'll hug him and wouldn't be able to thank him enough.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The girl who raised her hand in the first row when he asked what the name of the matrix is... :'( 
College is just a high level Dora the Explorer where the teacher asks a question, stares at you for 15 seconds, then answers it himself

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lesson. I just did not understand one part towards the end that if we rotate the arms of the angle O for ninety degrees, QPR would approximately be equal to O. (45:00) 
If it is just happen to be like that, is not the proof sort of incomplete?
Could anyone explain this part to me?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
so i'm a sophmore in high school n i was wondering if i took all these lectures, will it give me enough information to take the ap calc ab exam??

and i'm finding these lectures really hard....is tht cause i'm only a sophmore??

### 3. Independence
Prof Tsitsilis is just awesome! I have never come across such an witty scholar. Thanks MIT for making these lectures available in open.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Great lecture, anyone noticing that the chalk is getting worse than in 18.06? :D

### Lecture 7: Convergent Sequences of Real Numbers
There is a mistake in lecture notes, example 71. Example in the lecture notes picks epsilon_0=1/2 and then proceeds with 1=|(-1)^M-(-1)^(M+1)|. This is wrong. Epsilon should be 1; and the expression with absolute values evaluates to 2. The lecture video is correct, the lecture notes are not.

### 34. Final Course Review
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
00:00 comments about approximation
31:50 don't abandon your common sense

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great lec. I liked his explanation of the binomial theorem. 
moving forward to lec 2.

Watch out calculus! 
 HERE I COME!  XD

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I wish you had this before last term

in the case r = m < n,  then  
rref (A)  = [  Id.  F ] , if we allow permutation of columns.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He explain with heart and soul. Thanks for sharing. Big love

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ok but whats the actually difference between path and surface independence. Can a Field be path independent yet  not surface independent.... and 25:50 the divergence of curl of a vector Feild is always 0. Does it imply for all Vector Fields irrespective whether it has scalar potential or not.?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Can I find some slides for these lesson?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
go to start 
search mono
enable mono....now enjoy equal sound on both ears....you are welcome...

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This course would have been much better if the course site actually has solution for us to compare our answer with.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This is the second semester in math mit has. Their first semester is Calculus 1 and 2 put together and their second shown here is calculus 3.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This video is very helpful, i appreciate the help.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@[USERNAME]You should enable htnl5 player: youtube com/html5
it has speed option

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
very good teacher

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
pls anybody help me out! At @48:10 the sum given-->integrate 1/(xlnx). It''s possible by substitution method but not possible by integration by parts method.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is  the program the professor used to illustrate the plots ?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Mister John our respect from Greece!! Pretty helpful courseware.. :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There are two ways of solving for e^xarctanx. Anyone?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
jimmy dore?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I barely mastered long division, flunked high school algebra and everything he is doing looks like impossible to understand gibberish!  The fault is my own of course.

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I can't figure out how A could ever be a negative number when it's given as e^c and e is a positive number.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Newton's  method: this is a good example to see how mankind gets lost in particular problems, if you check the answer for square root of five you can see that it takes him a very long time to solve the equations and the fractions, while for me to solve manually (without calculator) could have an acurate answer  to the -4 exp in a couple of minutes the most. what it is nice is to see the interpretacion of the root in geometrical partabole.

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Calculus is not that difficult if you like it, you should understand the sequence of steps and functions, but in general is rather difficult.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I saw this video fours years ago when I was an undergraduate student having linear algebra class, and now I saw it again when I am a graduate student, He is just a legend!, No one teacher I have ever seen can be compared to him.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
20220530 簽

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
I don't have much time left for my final exams, but here I am watching all the lectures of the playlist.
Dr. Gil strang is a legend.

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
Use a digital board meh.. MIT

### 17. Markov Chains II
Respect to MIT.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Great lecture

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
LOL. Looks like he didn't want his 'little brother' to look like a *big* brother - if you know what I mean.

### 34. Final Course Review
I have just completed the course!

Realy nice and a good Teacher, one with the capital T.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Professor Strang thank you for great lecture that involves Norms, Ranks and Least Squares. All three topics are very  important for solid linear algebra development.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
"very appropriate for me as a substitute teacher to tell you about substitution"XD

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
The corresponding lecture form 18.03 by MIT OCW that bridges this module is Lecture 25. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heBvViSi9xQ

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thankyou sir

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
why is the prof so toxic at 10:28 uff

### 18. Properties of Determinants
He’s more effective with that one HUGE piece of chalk than my professor with her ipad and Zoom. She should just assign this as the lectures and be done with it.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Sir , Thanks a lot Sir.. ! ..

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
legend

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
A new course...
THANKS MIT 
:D

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Econometrics is in the air ... :)))))))

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I do make this statement, after understanding Polynominal Crystal Agebra IV with the X-Axis,Y-Axis,& Z-Axis Polynominal Cyrstals revolving around"TIME"= 4D Algebriac, & Calculus Limit Questionaires using Newtonian Physics,WHY Don't you run that"STUPID FREEMASON U.S.A. IDIOT Government ,Now that you Fully Understand the Mathematics of Our UNIVERSE,you certainly can adapt it to"SCIENCE SOCIALISM of ELECTRIFICATION-Photons of Physics Calculus-Algebriac I,II,III & Algebriac IV Polynominal Graphing!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
limits are used as a tool in a proof... we call things such as these "givens."    you use givens to prove more complex algorithms.  this is how math progresses to more complex heights.

by the way, you should be doing limits at 15 or 14...that is when pre-calc is generally introduced. 

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Near 23 min in, how did he ignore the i, but remember it in his next example with n = 4?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
@[USERNAME]You see the gradient is a sort of operator, when you apply it to a scalar field, it gives a vector field. The gradient it self is not the vector.

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Such an intelligent, yet nice professor -- taking time to answer all questions patiently...

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why did he use the third derivative of x(theta) but only the second derivative for y(theta) in the taylor approx?

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
d (S (fdx)) / dx = f .... S is sign for integral ..
It's obvious, but I don't know what he didn't say explicitly.

### 3. Parametric Inference
Prof seems a bit disorganized otherwise a good lecture series

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Compared to courses in my collage, MIT’s courses are just feels better in many ways, dk why, feels relax even on math courses, which I would consider ‘hardcore’ before. Really enjoy it.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He is soooo goood at explaining. Amazing

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Determinant has been determined. Thank you MIT!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I learned mathematics from the best teacher and started to like it ever since. Great thanks to you, Prof. Gilbert Strang.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
33:16, 40:50, I think it's incorrect to claim capital sigma is EigenValues. I think for square symmetric matrix it still has singular decomposition, U equals V, but capital sigma here is actually Eigenvalue square. Because SVD is based A'A and AA', not A itself. Can anyone help clarify? Thanks!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
hoah this lecture is tough but very interesting at the same time :3

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thank you so much for sharing these beautiful information with the whole world.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Can anyone direct me to a good proof for 19:36?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This professor is not the best I've seen on youtube. Not that he doesnt understand what he explains but his methodology is not essentialising the obscure concepts. First, he should have discribed the slope as delta x on delta y....( why f(x))?...or the obscure equation y-yo= m (x-xo)... could have been easyer as m= delta x/delta y....

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
muito obrigado.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, MIT is awesome for putting these up on Youtube.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
From this great lecture, I am finally learning the full meaning and understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in linear and system theory. DR. Strang is the  leading commentator on this subject.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Please look up to "The Venus Project" it offers solution to most of the problems we face today.War, poverty, hunger, starvation, illnesses,unemployment, crime, deprivation, human suffering can be solved with THE VENUS PROJECT. It offers method to achieve better world.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Brilliant. He needs to be recorded. His every sentence clarifies some linear algebra confusion that I had. Even though I have done this corse in my university, I still find it useful to watch his lectures. Even the most introductory ones, like this. Truly amazing job.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10/10/2019: Just finished 18.01. David jerison is just amazing.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Excuse me, I'm new to LA, and I'm wondering why we can be sure that [-1,-1,1,0] and [-1,0,0,1] at "47:53" are the only two particular solutions. I mean, could it be two or more?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So this is like algebra and geometry combined... with a bit of grammar thrown in...

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Gilbert Strang, thank you very much for everything you have done for us. You are the best teacher I have ever met

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Poor Schmidt. He didn't deserve the shade

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
much easier than the first lecture imo

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love this lectures. I refresh my math knowledge with them. Thank you!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent!!

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mmore Olympic erasing by Denis Auroux!!

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
For 48 differet reasons, I love prof. Strang

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why can't zero be in the pivot position?

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in every lecture of this teacher, why the students are laughing and coughing very much. that's kinda very disrespectful. the teacher seems very nice and sweet but the students are just making fun. they should respect him, atleast for mit when their lectures are on internet.

### 34. Final Course Review
what an epic!!!

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
god bless u man,nice clear  lectures

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
thanks so much for pointing this out!!!!!!!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Prerequisites please??

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He actually brought a chain, lol

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Professor Strang just pulls out numbers out of thin air without explaining where they come from. How does he come up with the solutions at 31:27?

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT, I now understand green's theorem!

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
@[USERNAME]me directing my gf on how to suck on deez nuts

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
The opening remark was just wonderful to listen to!

### 16. Markov Chains I
Great, super clear. I like his accent now

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Is Guass-Jordan elimination is only work for square matrices? What about rectangular matrices?

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Spherical coordinates surface area.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
sir,can we think of matrices as complex numbers in argand plane

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
thanks a lot for these amazing lectures. Who's the author of the textbook?

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
11:50 guy on left is watching other lectures

Excellent stuff.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Sir You are wonderful and  beautiful mathematician Thank you so much for teaching us for being with us

### 17. Markov Chains II
@[USERNAME]When the professor mentions that the system is singular, why does he say it is because  (0,0,..0) is a solution of the system. Doesn’t a non-trivial nullspace of matrix A make the equation Ax=0 singular?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
To do column operation the matrix multiplies on the right. To do row operation the matrix multiplies on the left.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Awesome style of teaching...Thanks a lot !!!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nice keplers law stuff. that part of physics got cut off because of covid for me

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Excellent , I was amazed to see the one to one correspondence between solving Ax=b when b is not in the column space of A and least squares fitting by a line when all the points doesn't exactly fit in a straight line

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Sim, e acho uma boa ideia esse negócio de ensino superior grátis. Pois quem busca conhecimento é o aluno, escola é só para o professor corrigir os exercícios, aplicar provas, passar o tempo e dar diploma.  

=)

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Beautiful lecture, professor. I really appreciate this contribution.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU

Penerbangan adalah jalur tercepat mencapai tujuan menggunakan pilot dan copilot utk menerbangkan pesawat bermesin jet dan berpenumpang banyak dgn jarak yg jauh dan melewati daratan lautan yg dinamis dapat lebih cepat sampai di banding melalui lautan dan daratan, mengatur arah angin melihat kondisi cuaca,dan mempersiakan semuanya...mesin yg digunkan bisa mesin sama dgn.kendaraan biasa bisa juga jet dgn aftur bahan bakar....standart pembuatan mesin sudah ada patent....hanya pembuatan teknologi baru itu ygvmasih di kembangkan teknologi matahari,listrik,plasma,laser,cahaya......itu perlu risert......utk buat mesin harus lansung ke lokasi supaya bisa buat mesinnya...

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Jackpot unearthed....blessed

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
very good teacher, love it!!

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Have about this subject at the moment, don't understand anything about it - low selfconfidence. but watching this lecutre - I understand everything again.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
just saw a funny way to write "8" lol

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Wow! Sure wish I'd had this professor for linear algebra!

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
The conjugate transpose is written with H for Hermitian. In quantum mechanics, we use the "dagger" symbol which looks like a cross.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
this was in an otome game

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I wish this guy would eat something

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you Professor Strang! I am going to get up early tomorrow morning and watch this video with the best part of my day!

I also need to buy a super expensive notebook only for Professor Strang's class!

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
In the ex 1. on derived distributions y should be in (0, 8] not in [0, 8] to avoid division by zero in PDF for Y.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't get a thing

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
"But now for the most important step: WHY..." This is what sets apart a math teacher from a great educator. 90% of people teaching GJ elimination wouldn't bother to show you why it works, thus creating a legion of students who act more like computers than mathematicians. What Strang does should be considered the standard, and its deeply satisfying to learn from him because of his standard of decency; that is, to respect students' intelligence and curiosity.

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
Prof claimed that A+b give the same result as ATA-1b in 40:39 if matrix ATA is invertable . But if it is not invertable ,what is geometric meaning of A+b? Is it still projection of b onto the column space of A?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Aah so that's how SVM works - chooses the vectors. I.e. the probabilities are highest proportional to norm squared.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms

### 34. Final Course Review
I started on 18th December, 2020, and today, I have reached it. I noted down every single thing, along with hundred of papers that manifest the thoughts of my own. I brainstormed, I suffered, but above all, I was enlightened. 18.06 is brilliant. MIT is brilliant. And Professor Gilbert Strang is spectacular. Thank you, MIT. Thank you, Professor Gilbert Strang.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
My observation is not a comment about the quality of instruction. I really enjoyed these lectures, and I really appreciate Strang's instruction. I thought it was interesting that there was no one there, I wasn't implying anything.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thankyou prof. Strang and MIT ocw for making it all possible. i just cant express my feeling in words..... Thankyou

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is the text used for this class?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
so MIT students don't even need to know vectors to get in?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
12:27 did he just put a question mark at the beginning? I though that was only in Spanish...

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Thank u mit

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
God, I love the way you teach!

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Brilliant, better insight than the original 18.06

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I got goosebumps the first time I saw this lecture. He is an incredible teacher.

### 16. Markov Chains I
really great! much better than my professor.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn't we calculate dy/dx to find out the slope at the bottom point? Though y/x and dy/dx give the same result in this problem, is it the correct approach to calculate y/x instead of dy/dx?

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
His choice of words are excellent and he makes the whole lecture so fluid. Thank you MIT

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Excellent lecture

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Prof. Strang, happy birthday!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Thank you Prof. Strang for changing the way to study maths rather than cramming now we not only just study matrices but can visualize itbecaue of you. Never seen a wonderful teacher like you.I hope I will meet you somday to show my gratitude. Highly recommended for everyone.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have decided to comment on every lecture from here on. So far I have fallen in love with Maths. It is incredible.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
You find one angle, then what?

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why they don't used the pointpoint slides for lectures? Though it feels quite cool~~

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow this helps with my advanced proficiency calculus class in my high school.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is art ! Thank you Prof. Strang

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
I loved the kindness and the clarity with which he teaches linear algebra in a playlist from the 90s. Now it touches me to see how much the passing of time has changed him (and not changed him at all at the same time!) after so long. Thank you prof Strang

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Amazing Lectures. If you think its taking too much time - Watch it at 2X speed. 2X Speed still sounds very clear.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
you can install the volume boost extension for chrome to increase the sound volume

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I got 70 out of 75 in my final linear algebra exam thanks MIT...

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Didn’t attend even a single lecture at this course on my university. Spend two weeks with this channel and went on to do past papers for two other weeks and eventually got the highest grade on this course all that thanks to this man. This channel deserves Nobel price someday. Thanks 🙏

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Loved that you captured your audience with the "kissing Statue" in relation to stats..... very engaging :) since statistics in a Phd program is so painful lol

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
You have to do some elementary statistics course to understand these lectures, but when you actually manage to understand this, it transforms all you learned in elementary statistics course. Everything suddenly makes so much more sense

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
amazing!!!!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I bet that the mistake was deliberate. It was a mathematical genius stunt , just to connect previous lecture to present.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
El límite de mi agradecimiento tiende a infinito :)

The limit of my gratefulness tends to infinite :)

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I get what he means, but shouldn't dy actually be chopping in horizontal segments?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is there any prerequisite required?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
What is everyone using these concepts for?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you don't like this professors explanations I recommend you to watch the Thinkwell calculus videos. Unfortunately they are not free, but I have never seen such a intuitive, simple and funny explanation of calculus that will help you to really understand the concepts =)

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you MIT OCW for sharing knowledge.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Gotta hand it to Dr. Strang! He's still going strong and loves doing it. Those students and all viewers of these videos should consider themselves lucky...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
for the people saying they did this in high school:  have you ever been to college?  are you aware that the people who go to college are all from different high schools?  are you aware that all high schools do not provide a good background in calculus?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent video

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
44:32 "I'm pausing on that proof for a minute..." doesn't complete it in the end :(

### 13. Bernoulli Process
30:30 why is professor saying that random variable L cannot be 0 by definition? Is it because the string of days is infinite and there is always a possibility of at least having one losing day?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
What book is used for this class?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
37:19
“Independence: that looks at combinations not being zero,
Spanning: that looks at all the combinations,
Basis: the one that combines independence and spanning,
Dimension of a space: number of vectors in any basis ( cause all bases have the same number)“

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
7:15 affirmative action and quotas yay!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Please correct me if I am wrong.
While subtracting 2*row 2 from row 3, the value at position 3,3 should be -5.
Also in b,  it should have been 10 not -10.
Please check 😅

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
who didn't understand the transformation of variables I recommend you to watch wildberger  linear algebra series on you tube it is very helpful, he will take step by step with a wonderful journey of linear algebra.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Do they provide certificate for the courses?

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It's awesome

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I actually have one more question at 24:19. Can I write the determinant of two vectors in columns instead of rows? Are these two the same mathematically? (Because the calculated results seem to be the same.)

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
MIT course doesn't have any ads

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
38:54 very important

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Yes but nobody actually pays that (unless both their parents are doctors...)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Every university has Linear Algebra some time in the begining because everyone don't have this in high school. I promise you, within 6 month if you study engineering you will be a bit humbled.

It's an introduction class man.. ^^

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Great lectures and problem sets. But is it possible to get related solutions? Or is any one working with problem sets? Plz contact me!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He looks he is french from accent

He is such a sweet man and a genius teacher at the same time

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
If we have any x,y,z to power greater than 1 then we it cannot be solved using linear algebra? If so, what is field that solves it?

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
He’s the best.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b

Every lecture is mind blowing

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
deepest thanks to u MIT

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
What a waste of time of students. Nothing meaningful is learned in here!

### 14. Poisson Process I
You are a star, dear lecturer.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
this professor is just amazing; I guess the guys attending are watching in absolute awe, melting in their seats, and that's why they remain in silence

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
With the avant-garde camera angles... film majors 10000%

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]LOL please look lower down. you removed them and are incorrect:)

### 10. Computation History Method
1:18:14 good question

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
He is great!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I could not help smiling when he just so smoothly introduced the concept of Basis Vectors. I was never able to understand it and now it seems that it was always so easy. The pauses he takes during explanations really builds you up and makes you think. Do not fast forward. If he is speaking slow. There is a reason. I am sure he is experienced enough to technically garble all the information and leave. But he does not. Please respect that and you will actually start learning.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
"In mathematics all the key equations have zero in the right hand side"

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
for now let us stay with the nice case where matrices work  😮
                                                                                           - sir gilbert strang

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for helping my insomnia

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
such an awesome professor. MI,T could you also upload single variable calculus lectures from him. The one you have, right now,  is very confusing.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I do not know how to say thank you. I started loving and understanding linear algebra from when i started watching your lectures. Thank you so much. I really appreciate  it. wish you the best.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
https://youtu.be/CssSU-jjb9c

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i don't think they're current, they're just the ones that are on the OCW website

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Finished (07/04/22). To the exam! Thank you MIT OCW!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)
Всю школу прошили?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, can't believe he was only 30 years old here.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is Saying: "the Square Root of Two", Redundant?

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is the professor's name ?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
sorry

### 3. Independence
In the king example, the question is ambiguous. "What is the probability of a child being a girl?" vs "Given two children of unknown gender, if one is a boy, what is the probability the other is a girl?" It's not immediately clear which of these questions to answer from the verbiage in the presentation, and given the fact that the latter interpretation would probably not be asked in normal conversation, I don't think it's naive to answer the former interpretation. Apparently semantics is very important in probability and statistics.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
non-trivial solutions doesn't exist for nxn matrix if their columns are linearly independent

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor reminds me of Stuart from Big Bang Theory :)

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I was just watching his 2005 video lectures of Linear Algebra and I suddenly got to this lecture. I don't know why but it broke my heart to see Prof. Strang aged so much. Such a lovely human!

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much!!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
key lecture, love it!

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why they asking about how to solve a det ( )? I learned before that Mult Calculus…

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So.. line integrals over scalar valued functions are not covered in this course?? How dare u!!

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
3:30 plot the points where the function is not defined, with new notation
19:20 general strategy for sketching

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]math is easy if you have a good professor

### 34. Final Course Review
I honestly don't know what I would have done without this course. It has been a real joy listening to Professor Strang. Thank you

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Rather, Theft is wrong, even if you give some of your proceeds to the poor.  I think that's quite a bit closer don't you?

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
How would something like a Bayes factor relate to a prior distribution?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I learn it from lec 1 to the last one! Thank you, Prof. Auroux and MIT!

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks! Will definitely donate after each time I finish one of your courses!

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 36:20 i was yelling "MOVE THE FUCKING CAMERA"

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
In difference equation in 11:00 it is better to compare differential equation with v_t+1 - v_t =A* v_t.

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
Now we need  a course on Complex analysis, Partial differential equations and differential geometry

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the regular professor is better! Well, I liked the way he taught the chain rule, but I didn't like the way he proved the product rule and the quocient rule. 

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the double integral is pi / 8 = 0,392699082

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
21:00 wow, I finally understood it!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I want in MIT ! Please take me there :)

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I understand his argument for A and B, but I wouldn't really call it a proof. More like a persuasive description. There seems to be a magic moment where he says use your imagination as things go to the limit and you see that it does not blow up it just continues its trend. I can see that but it does not seem to pbe proven, just plausible. The other proofs he has shown cancellations that leave only real definite quantities behind. I know what he says is true, but I would not call his proof tight.

### Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series
So remember here what actually are complex numbers. As we saw previously. And NOOOW as we've seen in order to "IN-TRI-CATE" in a manner of speaking the complete programme of this year... we gonna use the *vector real*.
Which is as you know how complex numbers in electricity are philosophically related to physic and so on. Here taking the shape of *real numbers*
#WTF 😑

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]
+1

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why are students shouting at the end? 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Chalk boards drive me crazy.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
A true informative lecture by a brilliant professor! Can't say how much I enjoy the way he explains every concept; so simple, so elegant!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Strang goes hard.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
39:35，The cost of columns is about n^2 or 1/2n^2？I think it should be about 1/2n^2.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
48:22 let's do statistics

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
At 23:00 why would reusing data for different questions lead to wrongful  conclusion ?

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
The way he explained the Buffon Needle Experiment. 
Wish I knew about this before.
Thanks MIT opencourseware for these lectures

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
nerd fight.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice.painstakingly explaining things nice.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Strang is immensely passionate about his subject matter; a master of his domain — a caring, objective, and gifted communicator, never an arrogant showoff.  He intuitively knows how to pump life into seemingly dry material, shows everything by example without skipping critical steps, follows a clear and logical roadmap that leads to a strong framework for envisioning and dealing with practical applications, enables you to learn the myriad of technologies without losing sight of the interconnections and the big picture; and above all, he puts himself in the students’ shoes and patiently works through the maze of potential challenges that they might face in absorbing the material.

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
$40  and You are not welcome'

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This man is simply amazing and awakes the love to mathematics in everyone ♥

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Even which students' have less idea in vector , they can properly understand watching these lectures...........
TQ so much sir 💐🇮🇳

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
One of the most important lecturer

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Remember that so long as you do not change length or direction, you can place that vector anywhere. So, take your result somewhere in the top left and move it down and you will see that it aligns with his vector c. He did not explain this well, or he expected it to be review maybe.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
This is the best probability course I have come across online. Checked out several courses but it has been simplified here that makes it very clear for us who graduated from school for a while. The teaching style is outstanding. Thank you MIT and Professor John Tsitsiklis

### 17. Markov Chains II
Thanks Sir ! I m so glad i ve had the chance to listen to your lecture its so clear and it made me advance in short time

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
 شرح جيد لا بأس به

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think it should be available online. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Its professor from futurama irl! Haha strang is a living legend. 

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
suppose I'm in 3D if nullspace is a plane can we not simply write nullspace as an equation of that plane and every x,y,z be the possible values that give b of zeroes similarly if column space is plane and vice versa for row space and null space of A^t?
p.s I do understand we can't write any of four subspace as a line in 3D because there is no equation of a line in 3D it's just the equation of the plane

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
this lecture take me 5 hours believe it or not. lmaoooo. let's go! we moving forward.

### 34. Final Course Review
Meh, good video but his lectures are not much better than lecture from my college. Most outstanding teacher from MIT is Walter Lewin :D

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
quiz tomorrow woo


### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
"god gives everybody a bonus of extra 10 cm"

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
Hats off for professor Gil Strang and MIT for this amazing classes.
One question: I may missing something, the last part, where he says that you can obtain the matrix G from D with this formula, I think that is not correct. You don't have the squared norms of the vectors and professor Strang assumes that you have it on the diagonal of D but diagonal of D is all zeros, am I right? Or am I misunderstanding anything?
Again thank you very much!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Did ya notice that the limit as x approaches x zero of (x-x zero) IS zero only when your multiplying by it, but not when you are dividing by it? That is seriously sloppy. We need another math symbol to say that the (x-x zero) in the numerator approaches zero as opposed to equals zero. If it was EXACTLY zero, then dividing by the same term would be illegal.

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
"had better be more than 18" was the correct answer

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
beautiful method. he even risks seeming stupid during the lecture but his method is so beautiful, so effective. He is a REAL TEACHER.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Many thanks to professor Jerison, Joel Lewis, Christine Breiner, professor Miller and the MIT for this excellent free course. Good education has never been so accessible. Off to 18.02!

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
No, he didn't.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I wish this was available when I was an undergrad. I would have came to OCW for every single friggin course. But glad its available now, certainly helps with grad school.

But you can review this or others any times as you want.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Love this guy. I did get a bit lost on the Taylor stuff but I need to review it and was here mainly for the parametric representation part.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Ahhh, "deserving" MIT students. Sleeping through the lecture. Noone to point out fast to the professor that he accidentally wrote 3 instead of 2 as the third coordinate of b. To professor Strang, my eternal gratitude for this wonderful series of gems and for showing us true beauty of linear algebra and math. Thank you so much.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't quite understand how (x+∆x).....(x+∆x) got us the term nx^n-1∆x. Won't ∆x be multiplied n-1 times instead of n?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Gilbert Strang is a gift to humanity!! This dude single-handedly made me love one of my most hated classes from college.
Cheers from Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Prof Gilbert Strang explanation is clear and definitely keeping student like myself learning Mathematics at 50 years of age motivated to learn more. Thanks a lot Prof. Gilbert Strang for your contribution in the field of Mathematics.

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
I'm confusion at  19:25. yTx = 1 which is the imposition,  but how to get YTX  =  identity (the matrix form below) ?  how to prove that  (yTi xj = 0) when i is unequal to j ?

### 34. Final Course Review
Is there a sequel? Like Linear algebra 2?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This is a masterpiece of explaining the basis of Linear Algebra, although it does not cover the advanced topics, such as derivative, used in ML and DL. Strongly suggest to follow the OCW full course instead of only watching the videos.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT. #Grateful.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
39:36. haha... this guy is a genius

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Dr Jerison is one of the best teacher i have ever met in MIT. thanks so much for your work.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
my right ear feels more educated than the left ear

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Hey could anyone help me to get homework. I REALLY WANT TO DO ALL THOSE QUESTIONS

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Lol I know how to do computations with eigenstuff and thought I didn't need this lecture. Then within the first 5 minutes or so, he starts discussing eigenvectors in terms of projection matrices (if you're already in a subspace of the projection matrix, your direction doesn't change). This kind of esoteric insight is why I've followed this lecture series from lecture 1. He gets my head turning every time.

Professor Strang, you are a gift to humanity, I wish you well! And many thanks to MIT OCW for making these teachings available to people everywhere ☺️ A lot of good will come of this

Anyways, back to the lecture.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Very good lecture.  Very simple to understand.  Thanks for sharing.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
16:15 why interior of Japan flag (second matrix) has rank 1?  Maybe it's 2?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Best linear algebra lectures

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Please stop taking the camera off the equations!!

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
What does he actually mean when he says "it's inverse is going to be big" .. he says it 2 times..  when talking about columns in bad condition and nearly singular matrix.. please help . And also, please tell what problems could a "big" inverse cause ?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I have a doubt, in projection we are considering the orthogonal distance and in lease squares approach it is the vertical distance.. how both become same. somebody please help me..

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
videonun youtube kapak fotosu çok anlamlı.çalişmazsaniź nah geçersiniz şeklindeki hocanın hareketi çok manidar

### 4. Counting
shouldn't it be 8/(10 choose 3)?????????? wtf?? Does he correct it later in the video?

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This makes me sad..I'll miss him and his lessons

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He got an A.B. from Harvard in 1975. Suppose he entered Harvard with 18 and got his degree 4 years later with 21. Then 1975-21 = 1954.
So he probably was born around 1954 and is 55 today.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
@ t = 8:45 If you transform the full rank Scottish flag i.e. turn it 45 degrees you get the rank 2 English flag. In other words, you can send the English flag with the instruction to turn it 45 degrees to avoid a full rank transmission.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would like to see the rest of these lecture

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
ear


### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
where is lec8

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
all these comments have me scared, I havnt watched this lecture yet but the last one was pretty confusing

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
All students should start out with a course in Group Theory
(& a *rigorous* treatment of Limits) 
BEFORE taking Calculus.

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Great lecture! But was the memorylessness property correctly formulated? I think it should be P(X+2|X>2). Or maybe I understood his notation incorrectly.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Can someone share a drive link of pdf of Gilbert strang Sir...if any....

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
THAAAAAAANKKKK YOUUUUU!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Real life sheldon cooper

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Pr. Tsitsiklis finds two envelopes with money notes, in every student's hat.
Changes the notes to coins, and tosses each coin.

What's the expectation that :
1- Pr. Tsitsiklis does something more exciting than tossing coins?
2- At most one hat, is available for Pr. Tsitsiklis by the Final Lecture (L=25)?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
sorry im confused how mc^2 disappear?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow,  YOU totally fail!   That is the standard equation for a free fall object, with eighty meters as the height.  

Integrate the equation to get Velocity.  V = -10(m/s^2)*t.  Get it?  He is rounding gravity to 10 m/s^2 for simplicity.  So at t=4 sec, the velocity is -40 m/s.

There are units  in his distance equation which are not usually shown

S = 80 (m) - 5 (m/s^2) * t^2

I hope that this helps you understand a little better.

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
I spent my years as a student. To teach something to someone, you firstly should motivate them by showing the point they will reach if they grasp taught. This is why firstly you should solve a lot of different real life example. In this course, students cant see the outlet of tunnel.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I couldn't clearly understand about vector spaces and subspaces...

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
is this who kevin spacy was supposed to be in 21? haha

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]so f'(x) is actually supposed to be something but he doesn't place it because it's long and anyway it gets multiplied by zero?

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone looking for an intuitive explanation of L'Hospital's rule: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu0z-sFfF8Y (Courtesy: Derek Owens)

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
難しいyo

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks! Now is time for 18.03. Long live MIT !

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
excellent question.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Professor Gilbert Strang is a great educator and teacher, I am watching his videos from many years now. I really love this guy. Professor it is my deepest , humblest and kindest request to you to make  a video lecture series on a convex optimization . Thanks for your effort , May Allah give you long age, health , wealth and Prosperity.

### 3. Independence
At 31:50 , why do A2 and A6 have a little c on top  to make it look like A2 complement, A6 complement ?

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
I didn't get the diagonalization trick for the finitary Schur theorem, do someone know what "phi_N(k) stabilizes along the subsequence" mean?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Everything in multivariable calculus makes perfect sense (especially when explained by a good teacher/professor like prof. Denis Auroux), until you are in the final exam with a million relatively new bits of information in your head.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wait ten years education will be free..

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow, who the hell still uses a chalk board. L2 Powerpoint.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
It is so satisfying when you struggle with linear algebra for a whole semester and then you watch these lectures and it all makes click. I bet it would be a bit harder to understand if this was the first time I heard about all these concepts because it's a lot to remember, but Gilbert Strang can explain why the rules we read in the textbooks are true very intuitively. Before I was able to solve exercises, now I am able to understand them.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]wow get a life

### 14. Graph limits I: introduction
Very good sir

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Hes really good at explaining, not like my professor :<

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How can you possibly go to MIT without having seen the law of cosines?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
...what b turns out to b - lol

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Where is continuation? It must have been on Friday as Prof announced. But lecture 8 is not that lecture. Right?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I just finished his linear algebra 18.06 from year 2005...Good Heavens! I've studied in university for 10 years and I haven't come across a better math lecturer. Superb teaching!!! I finished the course and I can comfortably do some matrix operations without writing them down. Wishing you many more happy years and good health prof. Strang.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
gauss jordan BIG BRAINSSSSS. Thank you Professor.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I have seen a lot of videos on the internet mostly through YouTube regarding random variables,  binominal, polinominal and multinominal random distributions.  I've seen several vids of this teacher and considering myself a guru on this particular subject, all I can say is that his approach, when it comes to teaching, is not the most adequate. To much theory and very few practical and clear examples. Being myself a college graduate and having the experience of knowing all lot of teachers, normally these kind of theorists are the ones who know less. They hide themselves in all this theory to try to disguise there lack of teaching capacity. Don't get me wrong, as theorists they're very good. Their lecture is very detailed and well studied. It's almost like you're hearing a recorder or a machine repeating the same thing over and over and over. Normally these kind of teachers won't even admit any sort of questions while the "recording" isn't finished playing (these are the worst kind). Even if you try to ask a question, anything out of the norm would cause discomfort, almost causing the "machine" to short-circuit. It's noticeable that he has a foreign accent. Maybe he doesn't feel very comfortable with his English and that's why he gives his lectures/classes the way he does. I don't know. I think I actually saw a video of this teacher in mutinominal distribution video where he actually says something like "the multinominal distribution is a NICE generalization of the binominal distribution"?!?!? "Nice generalization"?!?!?!?  When your teaching or talking about maths there is no place for words like "NICE". When you're teaching mathematics try to be OBJECTIVE . No wonder I have seen several videos of this guy and almost not a single practical case with a final answer. There are a lot of good videos on the internet that actually give clear examples and with final results like this one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWv0RUxDfbs&t=35s

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
From his lectures, I know for the first time the true beauty of Linear Algebra. It's so happy to see him again.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
purrrr the accent...

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Those 9 guys are probably from caltech.

MIT pwns.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Yes! Yes! I understood some of these words!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
thanks , very helpful, thanks to this i dont have to suck my teachers dick anymore

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
one third of the way through! So glad I found OCW, I thought pivoting field for postgrad studies would be a chore, but it's turning out very smoothly. Only another 6 or 7 modules after this one, ahah.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Thx,absolutely extraordinary lecture.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
MIT 
course on writing

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
his proofs are not rigorous at all.Like what is this pyramid stuff , it's just a series of squares of natural numbers , it takes like 2 lines to prove what it adds up to.I'm guessing he probably does not aim on rigor , due to this being a calc I course , but honestly a lot of times rigorous proofs are easier to understand than what he does.I feel like he tries to simplify things to a degree that they become questionable

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
really hope teacher has a good health.he helps me a lot

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
No real proof of the multivariable chain rule: I miss it at 20:27. Does anyone know where to find one on the internet? Thanks.

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Some smart people moved from CA to MA, and some stayed in CA and made a billion.  If only the probabilities had gone more my way.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
hard to follow....

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
For the last question in 45:48, I think the other explanation should be, if the null space is [1,2,3], the first column will be the free variable,which is quite impossible, Am I right?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
*This is 2019 and videos made 15 years ago, so what still top resource for linear algebra on the internet*

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the integral on the witch's cauldron example simply gives the total energy inside the cauldron right? loved this lecture!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i wish my university had that blackboard... it's awesome especiallty cause im SO SLOW 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is nothing wrong with chalk boards. If any school could afford white boards it would be MIT. Personally I find reading white chalk on a blackboard easier then those damn white boards.

@[USERNAME]yea i know i'm a student at uofm and we cover the same book in the same amount of time... our exam questions are more difficult but most of our exams are curved, i'm guessing there's isn't.... MIT definitely has better lectures and the students probably have a better understanding of the material at the end of the year

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Props to the person at 36:12... I was thinking the same question !! Now it makes me think I am actually there

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
(20:10) alternatively one can mutliply 2x = λy and 2y = λx to get 4xy = λ²xy, and use xy = 3 to get 12 = 3λ² or λ² = 4.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
47:34 A = Q*(Q^T*A) and obviously Q^T*A is an upper triangular matrix.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Dr. Stang --Thank U sir for making MCU great🤎

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]yeah, and seniors are picking on freshguys 

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
https://youtu.be/1TdZy5xYNXQ

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I understand that this course is supposed to be for engineers/undergrads, but this level of math is unacceptable. The whole proof is inconsistent, lacking plausibility and even the  conclusions under the given simplifications are false. I like this series, but this lecture is a joke.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank you al lot prof. Denis Auroux... you are a great lecturer

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
my computer is so smart

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Can anyone tell me why the professor says A repeated lambda is the source of all troubles in 1806 ? What happened?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"Maybe I'll leave the author to do that." See, it's funny because he wrote the textbook. :)

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Age is just a number.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Professor: "So it's -1 here. Is it right?"
Comment: "(-1) should be (+1)"
Professor: "Yep. That's right"
Now this is hilarious
P/s: I know he made a correction afterwards, I just wanna have some fun

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have just completed your 18.01 course and am now starting Multivariable Calculus. This is just as clear and well taught as the previous course. I think we have entered a new age of higher education where institutions such as MIT take the lead to post entire courses online free for all of whom are willing to learn. I look forward to seeing more advance courses in Mathematics, Physics and indeed all other disciplines uploaded in the future. From the bottom of my heart, thank you MIT.

### 14. Poisson Process I
too much information to grasp in one go.. woah nice lecture!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
20 minutes in, I am lost in information. I had to go back to understand everything bit by bit again

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love Gil so much, his voice reminds me of gil from the simpsons

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Newton only did one iteration.. Raphson added the idea of using x1 for a new tangent… therefore Newton-Raphson Method

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
very nice lecture, THANK YOU!!!!

### Lecture 11: Absolute Convergence and the Comparison Test for Series
How are you doing

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
"Real part of the lecture" starts at 9:55

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I don't get why rank(P) is 1 .. anyone helps me please.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at one point in the 19th century vectors were controversial but they have overall proved to be easier and better than other methods. Quaternions can be used to do things  ONE DOES WITH VECTORS.  These days many people study both altho vectors are more well known.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
This is the best MIT lecture on probability

### 17. Markov Chains II
Absolutely beautiful stuff ...

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
😵😵😵😵🚬🚬🚬🚬📵🕗🕣🕘👾

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You don't have to memorize precisely how to start the addition rule for sin. You just have to remember to include the two possible pairings of cos and sin with a and b, and add them up. The order does not matter because of the symmetry.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
A living master of linear algebra who is not intimidated by spontaneous insights as he articulates the deeper meanings hidden in the mysterious mathematical creature called matrices.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Abstract
A growing lattice with a label system of growth in every direction from the centre to infinity 
whole numbers for measuring size in connection to the size of the lattice label to size and size 
of the knot so that you can solve a measure from the knot size and size from the label in three 
dimensions to help solve Euler Brick problem?

remember the difference between a label and a size.

I will show each three slices of the lattice.
slice one centre is 0L0 this is the middle of space x,y,z
0L0 is a label and it has size as well its size is the knot size.
L is not just a label knot it has size as well.


rule for this lattice
A=B
pick size of gaps in lattice 20mm
pick size of knots L in my lattice is a squares diaginal = 10mm
example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
example of lattice

slice 0 centre 0L0 and centre of lattice

 2L0  2L0  2L0  2L0  2L0
 1L0  1L0  1L0  1L0  1L0
 0L0  0L0 (0L0) 0L0  0L0
-1L0 -1L0 -1L0 -1L0 -1L0
-2L0 -2L0 -2L0 -2L0 -2L0

slice 1 centre 0L1 but not centre of whole lattice

 2L1  2L1  2L1  2L1  2L1
 1L1  1L1  1L1  1L1  1L1
 0L1  0L1 (0L1) 0L1  0L1
-1L1 -1L1 -1L1 -1L1 -1L1
-2L1 -2L1 -2L1 -2L1 -2L1

slice -1 centre 0L-1 but not centre of whole lattice

 2L-1  2L-1  2L-1  2L-1  2L-1
 1L-1  1L-1  1L-1  1L-1  1L-1
 0L-1  0L-1 (0L-1) 0L-1  0L-1
-1L-1 -1L-1 -1L-1 -1L-1 -1L-1
-2L-1 -2L-1 -2L-1 -2L-1 -2L-1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


so a point on the lattice
example = 0L0 

so the lattice is infinite in every way so a line will look like this.

example y = 0L0 + 0L0 + 0L0 = 20mm*3 = y this line on the lattice
so a 60mm line.

example x = 0L0 + 1L0 + -1L0 = 20mm*3 = x this on the lattice so a 60mm line.

the hard point is a diagonal line 
example = 0L0 + -1L0 + 1L0 + (Knot=1 whole and 2 halves of a knot)
so 60mm because A=B so (0L0 + -1L0 + 1L0) = 60mm + knots

now a square
example =  1L0  1L0  
                    0L0  0L0  
                     
 
example =       1L0   1L0   1L0
                         0L0   0L0   0L0
                        -1L0  -1LO  -1L0  



now a cube

   1L1   1L1   1L1          1L0   1L0   1L0           1L-1     1L-1     1L-1
   0L1   0L1   0L1          0L0   0L0   0L0           0L-1     0L-1     0L-1
  -1L1  -1L1  -1L1         -1L0  -1LO  -1L0          -1L-1    -1L-1    -1L-1

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great lecture on linear algebra.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
great quality

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
You go to school to get an extremely expensive piece of paper which confirms that you know the things that others can learn for free :)

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
started : day 1

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Thinking back, I want to thank my statistics professor. God forbid this guy teaching at my alma mater. Just mentioning standard deviation without any explanation -- no.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
His passion at this age is 100 times more than what I have right now and I'm in my early 20s.Lol

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Very nice.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is probably a 4am mind-melted question... but why is a quarter of a circle with radius 1 end up as area pi/8? Wouldn't the full circle be area pi, so the quarter circle is pi/4? Or is this somehow suggesting the radius is sqrt(2)/2, which would be required to justify the area?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
He does not teach Linear Algebra, He teach us to see the MATH as an art form and tells us how to draw math, and admire its beauty.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
31:19 Is it correct to say that the sequence approaches 0 exponentially fast because we keep on multiplying by x, which is how exponentiation works?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I feel honored to have been able to watch your classes, it was a completely privilege. Thank you so much.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
14:41

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
https://youtu.be/BChhAS1sFvA?t=1599
26:39 I wonder that why he said if div(B)=0, we don't need worry about surface independent in Faraday law?  i only can figure out that  div(B)=0 means a magnetic field always is a closed loop.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Love and Respect.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I love this legend

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Don't you have to have taken calculus prior to attending MIT?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Inverse start at 21:28

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yo shoutout to the camera guy zooming in to help us see better

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Sir....could we have any solution book of your book linear algebra and its applications fourth addition.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
lets be real here....those first ten minutes, the ten I could bear, were extremely ordinary. Taking a plane projection matrix was a dreadful example to start topic.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Reply to a question below on why we care about the 4 fundamental subspaces in the study of Ax=b: 

In professor Strang words (not in this lecture) "understanding the four fundamental subspaces elevates the understanding of Ax=b to a vector space point of view, specifically, to to a vector subspace level of understanding"

It will pay off when learning different types of matrix factorizations, for ex, Single Value decomposition, SVD, where A=U∑V^T.  Where U is composed of orthonormal vectors in the row space, V of orthonormal vectors in the Column Space,  ∑ by the diagonal matrix of the squares of the singular values.

Similarly,  all other matrix factorizations QR, Q(LAMBDA)Q^T, etc benefit from their description in terms of subspaces.
This understanding/insight is super powerful, even critical, in Optimization,Machine Learning,  ill posed problems, etc 

Plz don't disregard this Vector Subspace approach, it's only apparently that it doesn't seem to shine when being learnt for the first time, but believe me, it's pure gold, and the clarity with which  Professor Strang explains it is invaluable
...he said it himself, it bends your mind when extended to sets of matrices, and to sets of functions (the differential equation example, a prelude to Fast Fourier Transform) but the dividends you gain are huge

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was waiting for the question that the student asked.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Come on, don't be such a hairsplitter. All this stuff anyway was not invented by Americans.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
He keeps talking about "subspaces". Now I want to play Subspace Emissary is Smash Brothers Brawl.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I have to say: his explanation is so god damn clear!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I m in serior high school and watching this vid for about 10 min i realised that my coaching teacher is much better than him.....at this time i 've only one que to ask..if mit teachers are like this why this is one of the top universities in world.Well I guess this theory has got spread somehow by one of these kinda professors of mit..don't mind mit guyz....

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
DR. Strang , this is an awesome lecture that demonstrates the power of numerical linear algebra. Control Theory/ Engineering uses  a tremendous amount of linear algebra to solve satellite type problems. Robotic systems, which is part of Control Engineering also uses a heavy dose of linear algebra.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
awesome lecture! Thank you very much!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Best

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
*Student: Professor, can you write a little bigger so we can see?

*Professor: It might be the board. Let me just change this blackboard to a whiteboard really quick. This eraser should help.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
why doesn't you guys upload the latest versions of lectures???

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
16:35 To be honest, you did wake me up

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I would put my two degrees up against a guy who can't find the shift key, anytime.

Do you recognize this as one of the motion equations in the vertical direction?

y = y0 + Vy0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2

y0 = 80 m, the height of the building
Vyo = 0 m/s, the pumpkin starts at rest.
a = g = -10 m/s^2
y = h,  final pumpkin height 
Substitute into your eq
h = 80 m + 0 /ms * t + (1/2) (-10 m/s^2) * t^2
h = 80 m -5 m/s^2 * t^2
dh/dt = -10 m/s^2 * t
Now at t=4 sec
dh/dt = -40 m/s, not 80 m/s as you stated.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:40 but which formula I have to use to find the centre of mass ?

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Marvellous!!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does this make sense if I just know basic math?

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why were the previous 2 videos “not available in your country”?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
If A and B have same 4 subspaces.  
Then their ranks must be same. 
Their dimensions must be same. 
Hence their RREFs must be same.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Absolutely an exceptionally perfect course! Thank you MIT!

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is one of the most beautiful lectures on Gaussian elimination.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions

USA education is shit. I live in Europe, studying Economics, and I had this in far more superior level. Proves again that even so-called higher level universities still are shit :) Imagine a public university in USA, equal to primary school in Europe I presume :D

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
41:00 that was epic

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I fell asleep to this...


### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Watching here

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
dear JL,its finding humour in every part of life,this makes life simpler

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Probably not one of the best professors I've ever seen. He's scatter brained, lacks method, and is a bit nervous. Calculus isn't hard to learn - this guy is hard to learn from. I remember my Algebra teach hastling us to "SHOW YOUR WORK!"  - apperently this guy never learned that....  His simplifying and shortcuts make things way too complicated - he really thinks 50+ students are going to know what he is thinking?? I would have failed his class if I relyed on his lectures... TO MUCH CHALK!



### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
For the FFT, there's another truth to be noticed.    $$w_{64}^k = -1.0 * w_{64}^{k+32}$$  Also for this reason,   -D appears here.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I Love how he seems to discover things as he is about to write them on the board. But he is literally the who wrote the book on the subject. What a good teacher!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Thank you Professor David Jerison and MIT. 
Completed 18.01 on 8 August 2022. It helped a lot. Thanks a lot again.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I saw example 2 which shifts (moves?) the whole plane. Does this mean that Translation is not a linear transformation? If not what is it? I thought it was a linear one...

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Bravo! Makes my UC professor look like a chump!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

THANKS!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
 You can even derive the law of cosines purely from elementary geometry and the mere definition of the sine and cosine. Just use Pythagoras and you'l get there.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
he emphasizes everything so good so that even the most idiots can understand... Great man !!

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]That's good and all for people in the US, but you must realise that as an online thing it will be accessed from people outside the US such as myself to who "calc 1" has no meaning.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
khanexercises . appspot . com/   <--- this guy is the only person who's actually gotten the idea of how limits work for derivatives and what derivatives actually are across to me, ever, in the abstract mathematic principle. 

I now understand that derivatives are, among other things, functions of changing features of a function and that 2nd derivatives are functions of changing features of the derivative curve of the original. (e.g. slope)

Why is that so hard for people to get across?.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares

### 16. Markov Chains I
Can anyone clarify my question....!
At 32.01 it was told that r12(n) = 1- r11(n)... it is correct intuitively but if i calculate r12(n) using normal method i got it as r11(n-1)0.5+r12(n-1)0.8 which is not same as 1- r11(n) (Here r11(n)  = r11(n-1)0.2+r12(n-1)0.5)

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Professor Strang, after a wonderful treatment of the Krylov subspace you leave us hanging with the question how to solve Ax=b. Luckily, it's in your book: GMRES and x=Qy and y=inv(Ht' H)H'b*

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
This lecture is amazingly put together. It feels like I am watching a well written movie, where all the pieces seem to fall into place. All this is thanks to the professor.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
@[USERNAME]Doesn't rotation in 3d space require two angles only, theta(zenith) and phi(azimuth)?

### 23. Classical Statistical Inference I
At 22:48 the professor makes a minor mistake, I think "the expected value squared". I think he meant "the expected value of the square".

You know, at first you start a new course, and it's kinda cool and chill, and you like it. And then, you go like *WAIT I BLINKED WWW..... WTF IS THIS THING???*

*LINEAR ALGEBRA INTENSIFIES*

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he explains it well, shame i haven't picked on him earlier

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
He’s not talking to an empty classroom. He’s talking to us.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
hmmm... this is interesting.I never had it in school that you cannot integrate the function exp(-x^2) analytically .
And then I solved some similar integral, of  exp(-x^3/3)... and got an answer and wondered why everybody told me this cannot be solved. Nope. You actually can.  Here is the solution of  the integral of exp(-x^2) :
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral+of+exp%28-t%5E2%29+from+-inf+to+x
the integral is 1/2*sqrt(pi)*(erf(x)+1)
which you actually can get by yourself also with the definition of incomplete gamma functions and integration by parts. You just have to know the incomplete gamma functions. and substitute -x^2 by -t. If you do that you get and integral that is almost the very definition of the incomplete gamma function. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function


It seems you have to be precise what you mean with analytic. analytic is all trigonometric functions and exp plus some sqrt and all their possible combinations....
Gamma functions and all kind of other integrals not included.

So no need to integrate this one numerically if you have incgamma or erf at hand. And I guess there is a reason why you call it error function. And neither do you need tables anymore

This is one example where analytic math has sort of stopped before the incomplete gamma funciton and other integral defined functions and a like have been invented. I guess this is actually a case where people would vigorously disagree just because they learned it otherwise without defining precisely what means actually analytic in this case.

I always wondered why on earth people think it until I came across this video by a german prof actually shading a little light on it. It seems this is only due to the historic definition of analytic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6w868U8C-M
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(differential_algebra)

 For an enghineer I would say this statement doesnt really make sense. Anyhow calculating gammas and gammainc functions, also hypergeometric functions is another story in itself, especially when multiplying special functions like exp and erf with each other to get them, that much I remember from calculating something also called F1.

Anyway... incomplete gamma functions are already seriously cool. Since you can calculate them within standard math libraries and they are the general case of many other special funcitons like error function, exponential integral, I think even airy. For many solutions of variable coefficient second order odes it was useful in many cases. And wolfram alpha knows how to handle it pretty well ^ (try for example integral of exp(-1/3*x^3))

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Shouldn't all the bases equal to b/n since they all have the same base? I'm lost..

### 3. Parametric Inference
He is Frenchy!!!!!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why where limit were not defined in terms of u and v in respect of x and y

### 34. Final Course Review
I am so happy that i finished this course but much more than that i grateful to you for being the amazing person you are .You have inspired me so much through this course Thank you professor .Love you

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The questions they ask just leave me speechless. Like how do you make it into MIT but don't understand [ x and x.y/y] are the same thing?

### 25. Classical Inference III
Thumb up if you made it to this lecture of the course on youtube!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, amazing learning experience.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
This lecture could just as well have appeared in the beginning, as the very first one, to introduce the meaning of a matrix (except for the part about using eigenvectors as a basis, of course).

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
My thanks go to Mr. Strang

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Yes, he did botch up the R3 bases.  Sometimes even us Mathematicians make errors. Far as the proof oriented courses versus the application/conceptualization they both have importance. Unfortunately U tube doesn't allow me enough charachters to explain it. Let's just say they both have great validity depending on your goals.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
My only issue is that the camera should have focused more on what he wrote (and pointed/referred to) on the board during his explanations instead of zooming in on him.....

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
29:14 , freeeeeee

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
He should have chosen another number instead of 7 to determine the inverse, since it appears too simple when 7 is chosen...

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
40:32 hahauahaha he really hit the nail with saying some mysterious function ahhwuauaHWWUWHWHAA

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That white chalk on the chalk board is so satisfying.

### 15. NP-Completeness
I feel like the construction of the clique graph makes more intuitive sense if a reduction to a graph for the independent set problem is explained first. Because the graph constructed for the Clique problem is the complement of the graph constructed for the independent set problem. It would explain the for forbidden edges a bit better

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Very clear and nice, to the point.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
53:24 I guess that's what everyone feels after talking so quick for a long time :D

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Good morning, Dr. Strang. It is always a pleasure to listen to your classes. I wish all classes were as well organized and thorough as yours. It is always a joy to listen to your classes.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]$20 unit huh here in Sacramento city college I pay $30 a unit its a shame that the cost of going to school is getting more expensive l

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
04:02 What does the professor mean by *enjoying yourself*? Is it what I think it is? Given the context of folding your hands? Well, I mean those people are still humans, aren't they?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Linear Algebra is much bigger than you think.
You listen musics in mp3 and play games in 3D just because of linear algebra.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great! But why there is no one audience to listen. Bad time they have missed the Vector Spaces introduction.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you. What a good lecturer 


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
could anyone respond: can a 10th grader from india watch these? like is this a beginner course on calculus?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oops, I meant differentiate, of course, not integrate.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
haha :) "as long as it is not periodic" 25:00 very mathematical comment

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Quite a bad habit not using the decimal system for science. That apart, nice course.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
Best Teacher in the World. I have viewed many lectures in machine learning but,  Nobody explains better than Prof. Strang. Salute

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
For the Cantor's proof, why do we assume that we can construct such a B? Also, couldn't such a B be constructed for a bijection from A to A and thus we could disprove that |A| = |A|?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I'm confused about why multiplying on the left by Atranspose gives 0. When he turns the equation into At (b - Ax) = 0. Can anyone help me?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
for A and B it can be used another geometrical proof using the f(theta) function's graphic, taking its tangent at theta equals zero and comparing to the tangent of y=theta . The graphic of y=1-cos(theta) shows a minimun in theta=zero and the graphic of Y=sin(theta) shows the same tangent than y=theta (the relation between arclenght and angle)

Seriously though, thanks for re-recording it!!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you, professor.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Nice

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I absolutely hate Taylor Approximations. I just spent an hour obsessing over how he did the calculations in the last five minutes or so. My mistake was that I thought he was approximating the entire X and Y functions while he was just approximating sine and cosine. I got the same result either way but I hated to see my numbers not match his.

Anyway, I think I'm finally beginning to feel the effect of not actually being in the classroom with him. I bet he assigns homework and the students get lots of practice with the concepts we don't actually see. I'm not complaining because they're being generous just making this much open source. But it really comes out. He asks the questions on the board and gives them some time to come up with answers and the amount of time he gives them is not enough time for me to solve it. (But I've got a handy dandy pause button). 

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually missing the homework problems. With calculus, the more times you try it, the quicker you are at it and the students obviously have more practice then those of us hanging out here.

### 15. Poisson Process II
what does 1 over lambda represent in the fishing example?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
@[USERNAME]I laughed like crazy. I just felt like he was saying : '' Please God let these kids understand the one most basic thign of all this linear algebra. This is about to be on tape! ''. Mr Strang is a great professor I wish I had him as teacher. Learnign alot from this linear algebra onlien course. Thank you MIT for creating open courseware

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
These tutorials arent congruent with the course.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
Coz I said so! Isnt that enough sweetums?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The instructor got Confused? with the cos term, C dot C has an angle of zero so, cos (0) is 1, this is why no cos appears in C dot C, has nothing to do with going back to definition of dot product, (so simple!)

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
love this lecture

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wouldnt it be called maclaurin series if the taylor series is centered at 0?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I just want to say thank you so much for your life's work in mathematics education. I improved my exam scores with the aid of your videos and textbooks. You're a real champion and we are the blessed people for having people like yourself educating us

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Clearly Explained. Thank you Professor and MIT.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Petty arguments between an Aerospace Engineering graduate student at Caltech and an international olympiad participant at the level of Grade 4 playground insults. You would think that being educated mathematically/physically translates to higher level cognition when communicating with other people? Think again.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why did he sum them to obtain OP?

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
not really

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=2619 should the solutions contain only two vectors rather than a plane or line in 3 dimension?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I watched  the open course to renew my knowledge on linear algebra and I have to say Gil strange had helped me understand linear algebra much more than I was able to .

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This man is a beast!!! I love when he says, OK 👌 He’s extremely clear and detailed!  I wish I had professors like him🙏

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Are all things defined?  

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Eh bien. Si j'avait vu cela avant le 1er semestre... j'aurais eu mon semestre ! Il explique très bien, merci MIT.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Going through the 18.06 course, it shocked me to see him in Full HD like this. I thought he only exist in 480p. :)) Wish you all the best of health Prof. Strang, I hope to be able to see you in 8K 240fps in the future.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I finished it too. Thanks a lot to MIT and to the professors for all the great work. See you in 18.02. Greece, 2020

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
So happy!


### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
28:30

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This sub is much less comprehensive than the normal one. ):

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He is french, btw

### 34. Final Course Review

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Bookmarks.

10:46. What the Procrustes problem is.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] i seriously heard 'an orgy of problems' at around 15:40

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks to Prof.Auroux from Korea !  전기공학을 배우는 분들 중 대학교 1학년 과정에 벡터미적분학을 배우지 않은 분들께 꼭 필요한 수업입니다. 전자기학 수강에 큰 도움이 됩니다. (다른 분야는 잘 모르겠음)

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Can we get the slides that sir is using for teaching

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The classes you are talking about are introductory classes. They are for those who never had these subjects in high school before and thus have to take it in their first year of college. Many students at MIT place out of these classes. The difficult courses come later.

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
https://youtu.be/NynHmcuc8Yw

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Hes the goat

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I do believe a more efficient block stacking strategy was found that I saw on mathologer but I can't remember

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
These lectures are really beneficial... Very lucid explanation... Thanks professor

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
31:20 How does he know that the columns are headed off in different directions?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
5:56
Most glorious bracket ever

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
@ 32:10 X subscript "pivot" and X subscript "free" are being treated as submatrices to enable block multiplication. Hope I'm right

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
THAT was the great insight? b must be in the column space of A to solve it? Well DUH, that's practically the definition of the column space. Major anticlimax.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
5:55 The imperial system showed its retardedness clearly. 1 inch = 2.5 cm is (nearly) right. But 6'0 isn't equal 150 cm. Because 6 feet isn't equal 60 inches !!! It's 72 inches, which means it's 180cm (more exactly, it's near 183 cm).
Shaq is 7'1, and according to above argument, his height is just 177 cm, seems like a normal person. In reality, his height is 216 cm, which is very huge.

Do i blame the professor? No. He gave a great lecture. I think it's just a slip of his mind. As a professor, i suppose he does work with meter system, which caused him to think 6 feet = 60 inches, which is very natural for those who don't use the retarded system (like the rest of the world). 

Can any American answer the following question in 1 second?
"131.4 feet = how many inches?"

Well i don't know how long it takes for them, but for us non-retarded system user, 131.4m = 13140 cm, take us less than 1 second.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Very nice snowing in the background.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
We're thrilled that you geniuses are now doing or have done this stuff in high school, but have you considered that this was the first day of an entry level calculus class?  Perhaps this guy is a good enough teacher to, you know, start at the beginning and describe basic ideas that build the course.  But by all means, continue feeling like geniuses even though you couldn't figure that out.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I dont understant why choose 7 on that question.?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
@[USERNAME]no shit!! lol... im an engineering student and i have to youtube all of my electrical engineering classes because my professor literally cant teach shit!! great guy, but a horrible teacher... 

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
finished!!! But I probably need to watch them all over again

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof. Strang

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think this could act as a proof of min 18:15 claims: 
* for the degenerate case, we have a line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) = 0 for wich z is allways 0 . It acts like the case of z = x^2 but rotated ( because the term affecting  y^2 is zero in the deg. case ).
* for the opposite signs (saddle): if we fix y=0 and let x increase we get possitive values but if we move for the line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) =  0  (the same as for the deg case) we get a decrease in the z values. (because y^2 is positive and the term affecting it is negative for saddle point case).
For the conditions of the exercise we start moving from (0,0) and the signs from above are in the case ( 1 / 4a ) is possitive (so change if negative). You can plot some functions on Google: e.g copy paste 6*x**2+5*x*y+y**2 and x**2+4*x*y+4*y**2

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
khan academy or this video

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT, for these incredible lectures! #Grateful

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am truly impressed his lecture.... I have learned about derivatives so many times but I didn't really realize why formular be made like that way.. or act like that way. AMAZING

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Was it like Halloween or something? In spring? :p

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Grazie per il contributo educativo.

He catches and corrects it in the next lecture.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Where can I obtain professor sra's slide ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank u MIC OCW.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Is this course for English majors?

### 16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values
Hats off sir

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
In times of Covid, I hope this makes young people realize why older people are so important. Long live Prof Strang.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
first thought:  that is some good ass chalk.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Linear Algebra runs in his blood (Prof. Gilbert Strang). I now understand Linea Algebra thanks to his amazing lectures and his  too much insight into this subject!!! He opens mind and unlocks concepts which are not naturally easy to grasp.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
@[USERNAME]lol

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
1:40 That's what I used to think...

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
thanks

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I think for the basis of row space, it should be all non zero rows instead of first r rows.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
How can any mXn matrix A be factorized into SQ, where both are square matrices (symmetric and orthogonal)? The dimensions are not matching. Or, is this only for a square matrix A?

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
After 25 minute  lecture I not understand  what you have done,please sir explain it

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Very good, clear and concise lecture from Prof. Tsitsiklis. The teachers at my university may be extremely skilled in their field of study, but unfortunately many of them do not have the ability to pass on the knowledge to us students in an eloquent manner... These MIT-lectures are very much appreciated and I have used, and will continue to use them when needed during my undergraduate as well as graduate years!

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:42 Why did they start clapping? Lol

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Man the first time I watched all this stuff I couldn't sit more than 5 minutes without saying What the F*S(FUA*FUAUF What are you saying what is i and j why don't u just say x and y lmao Now I watch it and I'm like well duh.. yeah obviously oh wow that makes sense yeah cool... I think I cursed these teachers like 100 times and I now take it all back and am very grateful for them lol It's amazing seeing how far you grow. For anyone watching stuff like this and scratching your head, stick with it. It gets easier with time.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Went to the later MIT lectures for this course about 900,000 people have watched this vid only about 50,000 people actually got all the way to the end. There's a huge drop right after he finishes what most colleges consider calc 1.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
I would like if the subtitles also put in Spanish, please

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The corn and vector analogy just killed it. I am not forgetting it till the end of my life. Kudos to Prof. Denis, simply amazing.

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
you make me more confident about machine learning，thanks

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
fancy tie!!!!

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I love your way of teaching since I started studying engineering 9 years ago.
Thanks so much for your love of mathematics and causing us to love it too ☺️

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Math ❤️

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't buy the last proof.  If one never actually uses x = xzero, a zero never exists.  In the limit we don't know if f prime tends to zero, infinity, finite, or undefined.  Therefore, we don't know if the final product ever approaches zero.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Lecturer :"i am actually tend to speak faster , so I hope y'all understand"
Me           : play in 2x speed

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hi how many total lectures are their in 18.01 and how many are skipped over because of exams mitocw?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow that was a great example of convergence/divergence

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
God bless you, Dr Strang! I've struggled with matrices and matrices operation since more than a year, and thanks to you I've finally had the 'Aha!' moment.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
7:04
Gravity's value is 9,8m/s^2, not 10m/s^2. Hence, the equation is h = 80 - 4,9 t^2 (4,9 is half the acceleration - gravity in this case), and not h = 80 - 5 t^2 as shown. How can a MIT teacher say it's 10m/s^2?
The formula the student asked for is: y = y(initial) + v(initial)t + 1/2 at^2. 
y= position (y at ground level, y(initial) at the top)
v= velocity (zero at the top)
a= acceleration (gravity in this case)
t= time
Acceleration assumes a negative value because you're heading down in the y axis.
I just took my physics final exam and I feel quite picky about this. 9,8, not 10! I expect 10m/s^2 from bloggers, not from MIT teachers.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
and he's much much younger on ocw

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
And the audience was speechless.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ahah! You exactly got it! I was very confused when he used the first time a limit without defining it! But I guess this is acceptable given that this course supposes a good high school education.

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
I miss Strang, but this is one hell of a lecture!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
how can the dim of symmetric matrix be 6 ?

"23:37 Wow... Respect to MIT. In my school everyone would have burst out in laughter and it would have taken like 15 minutes to shut everyone up again." - $180k education comes to about $1.72 per minute to sit in, and let's be honest, joking around for 15 minutes isn't worth $26.

Amazing content

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
About 6 years ago I tried teaching myself category theory. So much of it seemed arbitrary and ungrounded - though there were parts that made a lot of sense. Now I'm beginning to understand the "general abstract nonsense." I hope I can shake Prof. Strang's hand or give him a high five one day 🤓

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

guys, what does it mean "to take one credit"? does it mean "to take one course"? (I'm not from U.S. or any english speaking country, btw)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Es una universidad carísima y con un nivel de investigación formidable y enseñan cálculo de varias variables de la forma más pendeja y menos formal

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT and to a very excellent professor.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Seeing the concepts of linear algebra intertwined like this is quite amazing!  I have tremendous respect for this prof for taking the time to not only prepare these lectures but to put them together into a brilliantly clear and intuitively appealing mathematical tour-de-force.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you aren't convinced that the derivative sinx = cosx only works if the angle is in radians, you may want to google "derivative of sin measured in degrees".  You will see that they are not the same.

As for the 0/0, the proofs are done geometrically here, so you must look at the side lengths and the ratios between them rather than from an algebraic perspective.  There are also algebraic proofs that can give the same answer, but these are intuitive and easy to visualize.

P.S. There is not unrespect for biologists. I mean that they don't need to know maths very deeply

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor is wearing a green shirt and not a red one as in the previous video. *stares into space blankly*

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@[USERNAME]why? I think you fail how to do and read proofs in the right way. That makes you hate them.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
agreed! Definitely going to help for college =)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Row operations multiply on the left, Column operations multiply on the right. 41:00 - perfect clarification

Can someone explain colors to me in this context i don't follow. Are they discrete or continuous ? (As like integer or any number on number line)Followup: does it matter?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If you are confused why lim[f(x)-f(x0)] = lim f(x) - f(x0) like me:

lim[f(x) - f(x0)] = lim f(x) - lim f(x0) = lim f(x) - f(x0)

lim f(x0) = f(x0) because x0 is some known value and f(x0) is a constant.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
But at sin(x)^10 couldn't we use the product rule? Like take the derivative of (sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx*sinx) and use it as d/dx(abcdefghij)=a'bcdefghij+ab'cdefghij+etc etc where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and i are all equal to sinx?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the practical example with the blocks is wrong, if you draw them and track the centre of mass it will be 1/2 + 1/4 +1/8 and will form a geometric series. This will have a sum to infinity of 2 and therefore it can never cantilever more than double it's initial length. This makes perfect sense if you logically think about the centre of mass and considering the block sitting on the bottom. 
The power series stuff is good starting 22:47 but the practical example at the beginning is totally wrong (I think). Which is frustrating as it's good to actually see some application.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you, MIT!!!

### 34. Final Course Review
finished didn't knew linear algebra is this much simple on to 18.065 from tomorrow

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Thank you Mr. Strang. You are an excellent prof. Thanks MIT too

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This is not a lecture. It's a projection matrix that projects everything in the chapter onto the viewer's brain.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
That moment when I realized teacher is giving so much energy and teaching with so much passion under a 3 by 3 space known as "Empty Room Space". 😢

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
lol maybe thats the reason MIT is so prestigious, they have awsome teachers!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
In one word, he cares about his students!

### 17. Markov Chains II
how did he calculate E[X] in Birth-Death Process? , E[X]=rho/(1-rho) ?

### 18. Bayesian Statistics (cont.)
At 11:00, he is doing the univariate case, so the det part can be omitted. For the multivariate case, you need the additional fact that det(AB) = det(A)*det(B), and the result follows similarly.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
at 39:45 
can anyone please explain how we got that matrix?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

I've been in love with Math my whole life. This course is so satisfying to me.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
If in calc 1 they introduced the term argmin for the place where the minimum occurred there would be less confusion as students often mistake argmin for the actual min.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I like it fine :)

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How much time did the exam take, I want to take it

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
i'm done with linear algebra... but it fun to relearn stuff in a more natural way... :)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Explaining the 3 planes converge on a point doesn't require a visual aid: two intersecting planes meet in a line such that they are perpendicular to each other along the z axis, the line on that z axis intersecting a third plane on that z axis is perceived as a dot in that z plane. The dot is the product derived by the 3 intersecting planes.

49:15 - how can this curve "blow up" as you get close to zero? It's a probability density function so surely it has to integrate to 1?

### 15. Poisson Process II
45:57 we assume equally likely, bu prof. wrote 1/3 and 2/3 ? why

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] How many Nobel Laureates did your school in Spain produce?  Careful dissing MIT.  This is a required INTRODUCTORY course for all students.  Of course it's easy.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
my only beef with people here saying things like

"oh these must be kids who didn't have calculus or these classes are introductory classes for kids who never had them in high school"

is that it CLEARLY says on the MIT admissions website that a student MUST have 4 years of math education in high school INCLUDING calculus. And I don't expect MIT recruiting students who SUCK in math either.

Maybe these kids just want an easy A. I don't know.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
How is e = I-P ?  I didn't get this part. is there some intuition behind this?

Yes, he is correct. Since the multiplier for row 2 is 2, you need to multiply what's in the (2,3) position by 2 and subtract it from what's in the (3,3) position.1 - 2(-2) = 1 + 4 = 5. Hope this helps!

lol calculus was not created with students in mind xD

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amateur question: At the end of the lecture, on the use of limits for proving continuity of differentiable functions, is lim { [f(x) - f(x0)]/[x-x0] } = 1/[x-x0] lim [f(x) - f(x0)] if we see lim as an operator?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
fielsjd is right.  Your comment is ridiculous b/c (a) this is the an introductory lecture, (b) you do not know the difficulty of the problem sets or exams, which are often much more difficult than the class material, and (c) you don't know the competitveness of the grading, i.e., the "curve."  As someone who took Multivariable Calculus at a school up the street from MIT, these are all VERY IMPORTANT considerations.

Sometimes I do prefer the more imaginative, romantic approach to the first several lectures in linear algebra, beginning with defining vector spaces and how operations are made, how these spaces are defined.  I do however really enjoy this approach as well, it's actually a bit more applicable.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i cant thank enough. this really help us a lot where we dont get proper teaching. Thank you so much for sharing the videos for free. I wish every famous university were doing that.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand, why so many dislike?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
But how do you find c1?

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
At 27:27 why he devided a*bt by s*pj? What for this pj?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Why is the dashed line not a subspace? Is it because when you multiply it by the zero vector, you aren't on the dashed line? Can someone please explain that some more?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This guy is a legend. I love him. The neatness of his lectures is just like the beauty of mathematics, and 18.02 is definitely my favorite MIT open course.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
You can see how passionate he is to the idea of making everyone see linear algebra as intuitive as he sees it. This is what being a professor should  be all about. Absolutely fantastic.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
Your lectures are a pleasure to watch (and learn from)!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Simple Differentiation
y = x^n 
dy/dx = nx^(n-1)
Differentiation of a function
y = u^n
dy/dx = nu^(n-1)dy/dx(u)
Product rule
y = u*v
dy/dx = (u'*v) + (v'*u)
Quotient Rule
y = u/v
dy/dx = ((u'*v) - (v'*u))/v^2

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I never thought about the fact that Gauss' theorem could be expressed in the plane, although it is pretty obvious.

Same like Green's is just a form of Stokes' in the plane.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Give Laplace his due.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I can see why American people are by far well educated .
HAT OFF TO YOU

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good lecture; all familiar territory, but I guess it's better to start too basic than too advanced...

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
findings
at every entry it seems that a ratio of energy of any element and hydrogen renders half its mass 
I think that the kinetic energy of any element is the total mass of hydrogen 
what does this mean 
I think that all the elements are moving at the same kinetic energy and their distiction is a result of something else 
more research I require 
tell me if you find the answer 
please come and get me anyone I am growing tired of a peasant's life

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Man I wish my college had those blackboards. Nah, I kid - MIT rocks! I wish I had this professor!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
You can hear the students chuckling as they recognized the Golden Ratio. Didn't quite recognize it as (1 + root 5)/2.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ok... so mcdonalds it is

### 22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
What about the gamma canonical link (-1/Mu)? it does not maps Mu = (alpha * beta), where alpha and beta strictly greater than zero, into the entire real line.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Interesting

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks for the course!

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
37:13 Can anybody tell me why that is that way? (-1/slope of tangent)

### 24. Classical Inference II
(When estimating theta1) Could someone please explain me why the reasonable estimate of variance is the one divided by n, not (n-1) which we learned in the previous lecture?

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
whoever's working the camera is a fucking idiot

im 16 and i learnt this i one 50 minute lesson at school

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Its very very useful. Thanks a lot.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
The last thing he wrote at the end of the lecture was "FIN"... like the end of an old-fashioned French film.

I thought it was funny.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
If Jeremy Clarkson was to give us an insight into matrices like this.....

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&vl=en    exact video with beautiful graphics from 3b1b.  Prof Gilbert Strang has done a phenomenal job on blackboard.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
At 26:00 how did he find the inverses of E21 & E32 so easily? is he using some formula? I'm watching the videos in the MITs required order, but looks like I missed somewhere something

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Well done Mr Gilbert, congratulations

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pure beauty. I just finished this course just for the joy of very nicely explained mathematics. Thank you very much prof. Auroux and MIT. God bless you.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow!!
It's indeed a Tremendous class!!❤❤❤Actually, this whole series is tremendous! 🇧🇩
Can't believe that 12 years have passed of this!!!!
If I could be there!!!😥

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if only we have such a professor in italy too...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well,without any ambiguity, i claim that the A and B expression could have been proved somewhat easily and more plausible beyond the ground of probabilities by simply using L'HOSPITAL'S RULE!

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Simply excellent!! The Internet can save the world

### 23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)
Professor Strang ,thank  you for an old fashion lecture on  Accelerating Gradient Descent.
These topics are very theoretical for the average student.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent how the instructor uses proofs to demonstrate examples.  Many instructors just say, "this is the rule" ....

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
o.O i am doing this in high school...

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
an “introduction” ...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The video on my recommendation .And I cant stop watching . One of my dream university when I was in secondary school.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Great man. Great teacher. He really gets teaching. He almost becomes the student while he's teaching. I love his humour. "Feign confusion?" I love how down to earth and unfussy he is. God why are my lecturers nothing like him

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
1.25 speed seen to be normal.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
man this guy is awesome.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Great cource!Thank you a lot!

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
Great lecture. Does anyone have good book tips about bayesian data analysis on longitudinal and time series data structures with R/Jags? 

More specifically, I have a case with several subjects and several observations within the subjects. In another case I only have one subject. In both cases, the consecutive observations are supposedly time-related.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
EXCELENTE LA CLASE, ME GUSTA MUCHO LA FORMA COMO ABARCA Y EXPLICA TODOS LOS TEMAS, SEGUIRÉ VIENDO ESTOS VIDEOS. M.I.T. LO MEJOR.
 

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Has any body else spotted the error @25:21 

A^T A = sigma_2 ^2 /( sigma_1 * sigma_2 ) is that an error there?
sigma_2 ^2  relates to the vector v_2
while A^T A relates sigma^2 , a diagonal matrix 
i.e. A^T A = V sigma^2 V^T

or am I wrong, if so would appreciate an explanation

:)

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This teacher is great. He provides clear and concise explanations to what are potentially unfamiliar issues (to those that aren't well versed in maths such as myself.) Everybody has an accent depending on which part of the world they're from - even you. What's important is that his grammar is perfect and he knows the subject matter which makes him very easy to understand.

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gr8 Teaching !!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
The second time to see nobody in the classroom. The camera man is really happy to be a VIP student I believe.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Why does a 4x4 matrix have 24 Permutationmatrices when a 3x3 Matrix has 6? I don't get how they calculated it so quickly.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

Damn! I hope I saw this last year

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
omg.. this is just amazing, thank you MIT thank you professor Strang 

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
29:40 why do we use p=2 norm rather than any other p?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I love this mathematician's logical way of thinking.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
There's a lot of magic going on here that Dr. Strang doesn't state explicitly. It makes this lecture worth a couple listen throughs.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Now i remembered i studied in my 12th grade From INDIA

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Bạn viết chữ lớn.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
想知道他是什么口音，我怎么听着这么累。。5555.。。

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I am amazed how few viewers here are. Professor, your first lecture alone is played at least 24 861 000 times on a single open course website (open.163.com) in the main land China, and your great lectures inspire and encourage great manly Chinese learners .

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Uh, isn't every MIT frosh required to have Calc 1+2+3 under their belt before they even set foot on campus?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Just wondering...what keeps us from calling the eigenvector matrix E instead of S ?  Is E already used for something else ?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Wheres the applause?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
The views dropped from 3m  to 200k .
Quite impressive

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
These lectures are so clear

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Waiting to be informed why dim C(A) =dimC(A^T)=r but didn’t get it till the end :( Sad.
Were expecting a Prof.Strang–type of explanation.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
at 19:45 , when he says that that number of basis is 2, for the second order diff. equation. Can anyone point to a reference? I am somehow not so sure about it?
The basis could be three too, as x=sin(x) +cos(x) + e^(-ix) also satisfies?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i thought calculus starts with sets and functions first

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
saya tidak tau kenapa sy d sini

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
please share slides of this lecture.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Phenomenal video. Thanks Prof Auroux (o est-ce que je dois dire merci?) and MIT for putting this together.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This Lection was in 2007! here in 2022 i read in the back o tshirt of school boy "CORONA" (24:31)  hahah What a prophet he is.... ahead of his time!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
👍👍👍👍👍

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the interation is wrong cuz the answer is 3pi/16

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Minute 46: There might be a more simple solution. Instead of the Binomial formula I would suggest using Number of Edges + Number of Nodes + 1 = number of folds (spaces). N+E+1=S

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Outstanding explanation. Thank you so much.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
A mere thanks wouldn't be sufficient!! but still, Thanks a lot MIT !! and Prof. Strang, it clearly shows how beautifully explains the concepts, he really wants students to understand. I respect that ! Thanks alot once again :)

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Respect

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
THANK YOU Prof Auroux. I adore the way you teach. You make the distinction between what is self-evident and what requires further explanation (i.e., through proof) so plain to see. It saves me so much headache and for that I thank you.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Is there any pre requisties for this course??

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Great lecture. Thank so much Professor.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I never thought I would understand spherical coordinates! This guy makes it easssyyyy

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I haven't reached college and I know all the stuff and more right now. Guess, Indian curriculum is ahead in this aspect.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
So much comprehensive lecture I've ever seen!!!

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
June 15/2019-Very good lecture!

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes, I know this is the most basic math, but seriously do you imagine yourself going to your day of work expecting to solve integrals and equations? 

They should prepare us how to solve problems, because all the calculus in a project is often done with it by other people. 

I don't know, what's your idea of being an "engineer" then? What do you imagine doing?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
he has blessed berkeley last semester *_*

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
cook up numbers till they burn

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Darn GPS! It directed my car off a cliff because it was a whole nanometer off and thought I was farther over than I was!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
ın 25 :05 he says transpose of row1 tımes x is zero but transpose of a row is column so how is it even possible to multiply them. Shouldn’t it be just row tımes x ? thx

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Wow Mr Strang! He looks so old now.. Why does a gem of a person like that have to age? 😕

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
I am very much thankful to the MIT educational society for such awesome lectures.................................... 🙂🙃🙂

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
"The one thing about Math is you're supposed to follow the rules."

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
could any tell me which book has similar explanations as his?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Linear Algebra was never as intuitive as Prof. Strang made it seem! Brilliant!

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Waaay too much theory. It's much easier to watch Khan Academy and do the MIT exams than watch these lectures and do the exams. 

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome lecture! Thank you  MIT!

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
10:58 this is great motivative introduction to Courant & Fischer's characterization results.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does he know how to proof anything? because it does not seem so. He says things and doesn't justify them, I don't like him.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
because he hasn't given out the proof for L'Hopital's rule.

### 6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis
Wouldn't the simulation of multi-tape Turing machine on the single-tape Turing machine be a lot simpler if the virtual tapes were just interleaved. Like [a][1][c][a][0][c][b][1][c]... Then you don't have to move anything around and it would be much simpler.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Such a pity this quality of education including all the course notes, textbook content, and sample problems are not available to everyone. I give the entire world's education system a big fat Fail for their incompetence.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I feel my prof is so fking stupid after I watched this video. So clear...

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
16:45 why the second figure (square) 's rank is bounded by 1? I think that should be bounded by 2.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Cofactors are at 28:30

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Exactly, it's all about getting that foundation in place, which is why, even at University level (usually in the first year), it's necessary to ensure that everyone has the 'basics' down. 

It's funny that all those 'this is easy' and 'I can't believe this is MIT' comments tend to peter out towards the latter stages of the modules...

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I have watched lectures 14, 15, 16 over and over again, and gain new insights each time. Professors, including mine at the university, tend to drop the arrow sign above vectors while writing on the board. This causes great confusion for the uninitiated. For example, in this lecture there is an expression "p=ax" whether the writing "ax" means a (a scalar) times x (a vector) or a (a vector) times x (a scalar) is not that obvious. Admittedly, the confusion stems from my ignorance of the commutative property of scalar multiplication of vectors, which is, in fact, not mentioned explicitly in most textbooks (e.g., Lay et al, ; Larson & Hostetler). In retrospect, this "p=ax" notation is a prelude to the ingenious way of introducing projection matrix, which again, requires pre-knowledge of associative laws. Overall, these are great lectures that stimulate thinking. Thanks a lot.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
why the column of b is chosen as [1;5;6] but it is not in the column space of A?

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Now I get to know that why the children's of MIT are genious. This is just because of such a brilliant professors knowledge delivery. Best lecture ever had in maths.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Whenever i am going through his lecture I respond to the question asked as if he is taking note of that...
That much I get involved in the lecture
Thank u so much Sir Gilbert Strang ❤️

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I just want to say thank you to Sir Strang for making such an amazing series.I am really helped a lot by his series.

To all you saying you did this in high school, well, I learnt this in the first week of kindergarten. Bozos.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Thank you so much. This is the proper education people should receive.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 48:10. the 1/x factor in the denominator should disappear to zero aswell when the limit goes to infinity? How can he keep that term? Please somebody explain?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thanks for this lesson, e-learning will be the future, we have all theory, advice books in the intro, we have all to study, this e-learning will be helpfull also because many people will be at home and this => minus traffic , so minus caos in the city.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
The GOAT

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
From watching this lecture, DR. Strang continues to strength my knowledge of linear algebra. He makes the subject look so simple.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How can it be called as discontinuity past and future when both are connected through present?

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
this is really not the quality i expected from MIT, pretty sloppy instructor

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The way he explained (ridiculed) different notations for higher order derivatives is priceless.
Please, can someone reach out to this professor and ask him to say something about different forms of partial derivatives.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
excellent

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Lecturing to 20 students at slightly different skill levels is difficult. Lecturing to 150.000 spanning a huge range in existing knowledge, age and time(!) in a way that works for every one of them is impossible.

Personally, I like to do number crunching on my own. Once someone tells you an algorithm you can learn it on your own. Even if they don't explain it in detail there are ways to look it up. But knowing which piece of intuition he finds important is extremely valuable.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is the form of the  line element on the surface of the sphere? Can we transform it to Cartesian coordinates?

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks, got the hang of limits with log now!

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
How these eigenvectors and eignvalues are Helpful In Industrial engineering field.....????

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
So dear learners, how many of you are doing homework exercises? 😊

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Hats off!
The best teacher I would want to be.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
At 8:39 How the Projection matrix P is derived.?
I see that in the numerator it is dot product of a^T and b, which is a Real Number
How could the associative law of matrices is applied here is applied here?
Am I missing something here? Can someone enlighten me?
If You have, Give me link of any supporting lectures on this so as to clarify this particular point.!

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
The pedagogy is so good that I feel like I come up with the ideas myself.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Watching this in 2021 and gasping when Prof Strang coughs "oh no, he better not have Covid"

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
26:45 example of non-invertible matrix

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
This professor is so fabulous! One of the best professors ever!

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
For everyone asking about the bowl and eigenvalues analogy:
 Let X= (x,y) be the input vector (so that I can write X as a vector) and consider the energy functional f(X)=X^t S X. What would happen if we evaluate on the eigenvalues?
First, why would I think to do this? The eigenvectors of the matrix give the "natural coordinates" to express the action of the matrix as a linear transformation, which then gives rise to all the "completing the square" type problems with quadratic forms in usual LA classes. The natural coordinates rotate the quadratic so it doesn't have off-diagonal terms. This means the function changes from something like f(x,y)=3x^2+6y^2+4xy to something like f(x,y)=(x^2+y^2)=(||X||^2), where ||X||^2 denotes the squared norm. So the functional looks like a very nice quadratic in this case, like the ones you may learn how to draw in a multivariate calc course. 
Going back to the current calculation which f(X)=X^tSX: if we evaluate in the eigen-directions, then our function becomes f(X_1)=X_1^t S X_1=X_1 lambda_1 X_1= lambda_1 ||X_1||^2 (a nice quadratic) and 
f(X_2)=X_2^t S X_2=X_2 lambda_2 X_2= lambda_2 ||X_2||^2 (another nice quadratic). The eigenvalues lambda_1, lambda_2 become scaling coefficients in the eigen-directions. A large scaling coefficient means we have a steep quadratic and a small coefficient means we have a quadratic that is stretched out horizontally.
 If the eigenvalue is close to zero, the quadratic functional will almost look like a horizontal plane (really, the tangent plane will be horizontal) and hence not be invertible, so any solver will have difficulty finding a solution due to infinitely many approximate solutions. Since the solver will see a bunch of feasible directions, it will bounce around the argmin vector without being able to confidently declare success. Poor solver. Of course, these are purely mathematical problems; rounding error will probably mitigate the search even further.

Edit: changed "engenvalue" to "eigenvector" in 2nd paragraph.

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
Dear Prof. Strang, it is actually very easy to visualize a saddle point. x/|x| is an ort that is fully defined on a 3D spherical surface that can be projected on any 2D plane without loosing any info. Choose (u,0,w). Any point within the unity circle represents the 2D ort. Zero radius (0,0) -> (0,0,1) . Then you plot R(u,w) = R(u,v,w) provided u^2+v^2+w^2=1; i.e. v=sqrt(1-u^2-w^2); You will see max =5 at (1,0), min=1 at (0,1) and 3 at (0,0).

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
1st Example:

U = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Sigma = [[sqrt(18), 0], [0, sqrt(32)]]
V = V^T = [[-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]]

where [a, b] is interpreted as a row vector. A = [[4, 4], [-3, 3]] = U * Sigma * V^T .... try it.

We know what we're doing, but we're not computers...we make little errors once in a while that we can't track successfully. The core concept was brilliantly delivered, and Professor Strang did an exceptional job making us understand SVD. I didn't bother to find his computational error ☺️

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I have an A in my linear algebra course and it sure isn't because of the Textbook, thank you MIT and Gilbert Strang for making these videos free

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
On the contrary. People with insecurities are easy to manipulate. A superiority complex is a deeply rooted insecurity. Good luck surviving the world with that heavy baggage (your big ego).

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wtf

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
remember on looney toons when they would run in place before taking off?  thats how this guy is.  he just seems so excited his mouth wants to blurt it out but his mind is a fraction behind.... whose idea was it to include stutters in the subtitiles?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
OMG, this is magic.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why not use a bigger black board?


### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At 36:40 every right hand side 'b' corresponds to the ones within A's column space, right?

Young God

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
What do I do if I want to allow also some dependent column vectors in A so that AtA is not invertible? The projection onto the column space of A surely must still be unique. How do I find the projection matrix using my A in this case?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i never know that youtube have video like this.
good.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
no because x is defined by the limit signifier.  it cannot be divorced from it

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Very nice and concise explanation. Thanks.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Self teaching linear algebra is 100x easier with these lectures!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You don't need high-tech touch screens or ipads to learn anything.All a teacher needs is a chalk and a blackboard and all a student needs is a paper and a pen.Moreover It's very bold and legible to write on a blackboard and the visiblity is great.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
the best course to learn linear algebra

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I studied this in my school while preparing for IITs entrance exams , Even more tougher it's easy.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
attend to the strang paradox; a vector field of unfinished sentences that form the basis vectors for a stunning range of interesting algebraic problems

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you a lot.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
my distance to my crush is 100k GGs bois

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I enjoy watching these videos.  Makes me wish I had paid attention to my studies and teachers when I was in school.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if differentiation is to find the rate of change. then why are we doing it to find the area?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Great teacher. Thank you very much

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
so cul.


### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Thank you so much! This was so useful and easy to understand!

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Oh wow 🤩 , almost get there oonly stroke’s thm left  over hahahah  finish all of 18.01 and 18.02 , learn more than I expected

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Yes in fact, the shoes-socks rule stands well in this science

### 33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function
Just once to see one of his lectures and not be amazed. He is simply awesome!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is chalk bad for the lungs?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
what a don! i wish my lecturer was this guy, he makes it so simple

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
I love Linear Algebra!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
@[USERNAME]from what I understand we are projecting b in to the column space so that we can actually solve the system with a best estimate.  The closest (least squares) projection of b is p which will only be orthogonal if b happens to be in the null space of A transpose, but there is no requirement that this is the case.  In fact if b happens to be in the column space, then the projection doesn't change b at all (i.e. P = I.)

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
watching this in 2016. What's hillary's distance to Monica. LOL

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
which lecture did he speak about full column rank?

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
I can see and prove a covariance matrix with x and y independent is a positive definite matrix.  But when x and y are dependent, I don't think the covariance matrix V is positive semidefinite.  In the 2x2 case uT*V*u could be less than zero for the case when u = [1; -1] for instance.

### 34. Final Course Review
can anyone provide me notes

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Derivatives of products, quotients, sine, cosine

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Cross product is easy.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Isn't this theorem called after Ostrogradsky, since he is the first one to prove it?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
28:14 I promise not to write another thing on this board xD :) Thank you so much Prof. your lectures are way more intuitive than my college Prof.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
At around 32:45, Prof. Strang writes Lambda^100*S*c. Notation wise, shouldn't this be S*Lambda^100*c? 

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
At 8:11 shouldn't S be (1/n)*Σ(X*X^T) ? Why he omitted 1/n?
Edit: ok, he fixed it at 9:29 :)

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
why the blackboard seems a little dirty?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Thank you!!! I’m excited

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
some of the in class questions belong at Dartmouth not MIT

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I.got really confused when he said the elimination does change the column space. Why? Is that right?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
My distance to clinton updated to 3 from infinity after this lecture

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
A couple of questions:
1) if a single element has 0 probability, why a singleton has a probability greater than 0?
2) the first additivity axiom and the countable additivity axiom both say that the probability of the union of disjoint events is equal to the probability of the sum of each individual probability. In what they actually differ?

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Thank you!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
O, to have had a professor like this who wanted you to learn math, unlike my classes which were meant to eliminate as many students going forward as possible.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 4. Counting
This is an ingenious way of determining number combinations

### 20. Central Limit Theorem
how is standard deviation is f(1-f)..at 19:40 ???

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Don't give up. ( 加油！)

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The professor is looking rather green. He must sick. 

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME] So what, who cares?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Hard to get the last idea he mentioned

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
prof. says A, writes B, means C - while correct answer is D.

### Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem
Well i can proudly say that in India a normal YouTube channel can explain this much much better than this one

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
A good professor gets down to the level of a student and stops assuming things. A great professor gets down to the level of the weakest (new to the field) student in the class and makes them feel that they are not alone. And he is an excellent professor. Thank you MIT.

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
45:10 I assume h(x) should be 1/sqrt(2pi)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How is it 2 40:50?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Great lecture! But aren't we supposed to make an orthogonal projection? Instead he did a projection parallel to the Y-axis because he calculates p1, p2 and p3 by taking t-values 1, 2 and 3. You can also see it on his drawing. Why does he take this projection instead of the orthogonal one? And how can e turn out to be orthogonal to p anyway?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
did this in grade 9


### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like how people in the comments section are mulling over the Professor's treatment of the material in this course, completely forgetting the fact that courses like these will usually have textbooks associated with them to augment learning and the professor's job is NOT to regurgitate things that can be found in a textbook but to focus on the key concepts required in problem solving. 

It amazes me that some people feel that there's a need to do 10 whiteboards worth of derivations in a 50 minute course when the focus should ALWAYS be on the concepts, with the professor encouraging students to look up the derivation or the individual proofs. It's good that the professor managed to do the derivation at the end, cos it just reinforces the concepts and also provides a general methodological framework which students can then use to solve general problems.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Let's keep it to oursselves/myself...






So y=1/x -> dy/dx * -1/x is also accurate by nx^(n-1).

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
He cited  images as an example for large feature set : nobody use standard ML for images, we use Convolution.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Professor Gil Strang has spoilt our learning process, so much intuition is mesmerizing.  I started LA for the first time to learn on my own, and if I know this subject then all credits to him and MIT. ❤️

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I just skipped my calculus class today to watch this video instead. I must say it was worth it.

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Anyone can explain how the did he get the term in the parenthesis at 39:07? Why does Transpose(v)[1] = Transpose([1])v?

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT🙏

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I never Get bored watching these lectures.Prof.Gilbert Strang is awesome!!

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
At 22:00 M = B only applies if B is invertible right? What about other cases when B isnt?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
why at 44:50 do all the linear combinations of col 1 and col 2 create a plane rather than all of R^3?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Orthogonality is just a complicated word from Greek to say things are perpendicular! 😜😜

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Thanks for uploading.!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Prof. Tsitsiklis can not be thanked enough for his outstanding capability to bring immediate clearness into these topics. These videos truely are an invaluable contribution to education.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
There is a mistake the <-3,3,-6> from before is the vector of the line not a point on the line (even though that point does exist on the line, it is only because the line passes through zero),  so he shouldn't have written (-3,3,-6)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Amazing approach to teaching matrix algebra. Thanks a lot to professor Strang and MIT for bringing this lecture for free.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Seriously, it just doesn't get much better than this. What a well-delivered series of lectures from a clearly gifted teacher and mathematician. 

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
Would have been nice to put in the description or title or somewhere that this lecture focus on Fisher Information (Matrix) - to make it easier to search...I honestly don't know how or why I found this...especially since it was at the bottom of my search results. MIT videos that are relevant should be at the top...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
got everything down, except when he drew the plane of the column vector... I can't really visualize it.  

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is such a nice lecture, learnt a lot. Great.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
What a lame presentation. A completely ill prepared professor...

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

i think i just figured it out actually. half makes sense to me

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
the audio is so low even when i turn up all volume. prof needs to put his mike anywhere but his chest plz. specifically talking about parts around 33:18. mans whispering. and you can't even hear what the students are asking. but i guess since this is opencourseware, i can't complain much about free college lectures.

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You also have to realize people come from different backgrounds and won't know the same information. 

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
camera guy needs to zoom out a bit in some parts.

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wonderful teacher

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
symbology after symbology after symbology....its like learning japanese or icelandic but less intuitive .... i think anybody can learn higher mathematics....but why would you want to?  what is the motivation for piling symbologies on top of definitions on top of rules ad infinitum?  it can be done with enough discipline and repetition, but why would anybody want to?  to make bigger better hydrogen bombs?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It will get even better - think I have seen all videos 3 times now - but a do not think my techer have.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow...52:33...what kind of students do they admit into MIT...
Nevertheless, great lecturer.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I must say that I have been very disappointed by this lecture series so far. I am already familiar with single variable calculus. However, I am watching this series to review for some future classes (things like multivariable calculus and real analysis). 

However, here are some things I have noticed. Would that this instructor had spent some more time on the more rigorous concepts of limits and squeeze theorem, he would not have had to spend so much time trying to justify the proofs of the main two limits of this lecture. In addition to this, his students would be better prepared for future mathematics. As it stands, these students are really at a loss when it comes to their future.

I would really hope that instructors learn from this. Spend more time on the things you need to rigorously justify your claim: the foundations. If the ideas are glossed over, then everyone loses. Students don't understand why something is true, and so they become convinced that what the professor is doing is some kind of witchcraft that makes no sense. Please, if you are an instructor and you are reading this, work on the fundamentals!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
26:20 Can anyone explain for me why we can have the same column space when we throw column 1 of Matrix A.? I still don't get it.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Lv

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments
What a doozy. Great lecture.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Around 18:02 when prof strang shows when we would get a symmteric matrix, he mutiplies R^t with R .  Didn't he wrote the order in reverse? wouldnt it be R into R^t??

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
YOU ARE A STAR, PROF. STRANG!

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
For those confused about Auroux's loose definition of "potential," especially with regard to electrical potential, it comes down to an extra charge in the numerator that he somehow neglects.

The integral of (gradient of f dot dr) where f is the electric force (denoted by F) is equal to the Work, and also equal to the change in U, the potential energy. 

The integral of (gradient of f dot dr) where f is the electric field (denoted by E) is equal to the change in V, the electrical potential, which varies from U in that it has one charge in the numerator, rather than two. 

In other words: F --> U  by line integral ; E --> V by line integral. F does not --> V by line integral.

I recommend watching the final video in the 3B1B “essence of linear algebra” series before you watch this one

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
cry about it. When you do something that stupid in MIT while tons of capable white and asian students get closed out due to "fairness" and "equality" I won't shut my mouth. Fuck you.
"...Thus, the libertarian opposes compulsory segregation and police brutality, but also opposes compulsory integration and such absurdities as ethnic quota systems in jobs."

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Hopefully I can still love science at this age

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
God bless the internet. 

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
14:11 - he just launched into this.  No theory, no description of the "plan" behind what we were doing.  Can we get some THEORY of this instead of taking up time working out algebra?  What we actually DO with these ideas?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Great lecture, Thanks prof. Strang.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I had the same problem as in 20:15 and the lecture notes had not pointed out the answer. I wish they had.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
matrix*vector is linear combination of the columns of the matrix, and vector*matrix is linear combination of the row of the matrix.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
I finally get things better after this lecture.  All the examples really helped.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
An excellent step by step proof that the calculus I've been learning is garbage all these years

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Judging by his name and his accent I`m pretty sure that he is French 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
save the chalkleader. save the world. (heroes reference)

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I am kind of confused about the definition of orthogonal vectors. Why do we need to make the product of the transpose A and another vector? I assume the product of A and B is zero as well. Can anybody answer my questions?

### 34. Final Course Review
Finally went to all the videos to upvote. The videos  were so absorbing that I couldn't upvote during the lectures.
Thanks Professor Gilbert. You're awesome. May God bless you.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
great lecture as always, I got lost when it comes Euler Equation. don't quite understand how column, rows become nodes, edges, and why do we need #node -1 in the equation. The answer is probably in the matrices representation of the graph.  248k views for this lecture, last one was close to 300k. lets see how many views is next lecture.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
But what is the application of clarifying the partial notation in the presence of constraint, apart from a better understanding of what are the independent variables? Isn’t optimization with a constraint the job of Lagrange Multiplier?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
i appreciate how leaders in their field can     teach         the simple parts       with enthusiasm

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
at 46:18 the equation written on the board A(T)CAx = f is missing the minus sign. When we calculate the potential drop e, AX is negative because potential is dropping, and if there is a Voltage Source b connected then e = b - AX. Now Balance equation becomes A(T)CAX = -f.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]His name is Denis Auroux. 

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
now i can understand everything in terms of linear combination of column vectors

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
This was probably the most beautiful lecture I have ever watched. The way the knowledge is passed, step after is step is pure poetry. Thank you Prof. Strang.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
quem entender ingles me explique a finalidade do video!

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
21:00

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Can someone explain why exactly is it (P)(A)=(L)(U)?
I mean if I follow the steps one by one, its   
(P1)(E1)(A) = (U1),   (where E1 is the first row operation elementary matrix, P1 is the permutation matrix if any row exchange follows E1 and U1 is the resulting matrix)
then, (P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U2)
then, (P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U3)
... so on ....
finally, (Pn)(En)...(P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (Un) = (U)
Now this means 
A = ((Pn)(En)...(P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1))' (U), 
(' denotes inverse here)
How does this convert to PA=LU ???????

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does this course need a prerequisite course - 18.01 Single variable Calculus?

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
At 46:00 professor says SVD in this case is neither side inverse but Right side is one side inverse, then he says at end under independent columns SVD gives same result as Guass, but sigma matrix in pseudo inverse should still have missing values how will they give same result?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Prof. Gilbert Strang inspires everyone. I respect him a lot.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the professor is really into the subject and is really explaining   good. i guess he is a pupil of albert einstien.wallah professor

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule

I thank MIT for uploading these videos, and thanks to them I can learn physics and math better than my high school, where unfortunately education is terrible, now enters University, and and I can solve all the guides for the exam too fast thank all videos of MIT I saw, my warmest thanks from Mexico

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Reminds me of the role of Alan Turing in The imitation game.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
it was explained in the previous lecture

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Second derivative test starts at about 30:00
:)

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I think that for to figure out how a space looks like, you must ask yourself how a space looks like... because a subspace is in fact a space inside another space, so just imagine that instead of being in a three dimensional space we are in a 3 dimensional subspace inside another bigger-dimensional space and a null-space turns to be the space of all vectors in that bigger-dimensional space that when multiplies any array of 3 basis vector of our "subspace R^3" that nullifies our space (makes it 0)

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
listening to Strang is like getting a brain massage

I've been able to do two years' worth of my university math over a single summer thanks to MIT OCW.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
And my teacher just said "this is the formula"(explained a sum) and that's it for the topic

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mit cant afford dry erase....

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At sme 30 min he completely forgets ot 18.01 he is addressing.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Closing comment was confusing. What did he mean by permutations can either be odd or even?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is taught at what level?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Isn't it great that the sum total of all human knowledge is in this age at our fingertips? The idea that I could learn absolutely anything to any depth I please with effort and time has never been truer, and I find it inspiring :)

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Dear Prof Strang, You are my hero in mind. I want to be grow old like you.

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
i think the s should be squared in the variance 1/s^2(c^2 - ||AB||^2) ?

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
superelipses

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.
 
1. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
2. Do you think there is an afterlife? 
3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? 
4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?
 
No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness: 
 
1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? 
2. Have you ever stolen? 
3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?
4. Jesus said that "whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? 
5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? 
6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?
 
The Bible says that "all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone" (Revelation 21:8) and "Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell? 
 
2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. 
 
What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. 
 
When are you going to do that?
 
Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Great explanation Kudos professor
I initially had doubt at why E(x-1/x-1>0)=E(x)+1 but i did not understand there.But then u explained that he wasted one toss + he started again that make sense to me.
Really i'm loving probability because of u 
Last but not least Thanks for mit for providing such excellent videos

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
41:13

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
At around 18:00, why did he take p1, p2 and p3 on the same vertical line as b1, b2 and b3 respectively? Why not take them on the line perpendicular to the line we drew (I mean why not project them properly??) Bcos the line we drew is not perpendicular to the vertical. Help pls. Thanks :)

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
What does Professor Strang mean with “you cannot overflow…”?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
I want to know more about sample sets with no probability.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
It amazes me how much a good teacher helps in grasping the subject. Thank you professor Strang

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I think he made the mistake on propose to show the column space and row space have the same dimension lol

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
For a moment I thought my left ear had given up.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
very cute old man

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, its a vector space!

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
"It could be positive SEMI-definite - you know, consolation prize" :D hahaha

### 13. Bernoulli Process
professor john tsitsiklis is a G.O.A.T

### Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication
Con someone help me understand what happens in 12:30? cant understand what he did there.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
How can we find his 5 lines proof of why SGD works? It is fascinating.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
wtf MIT students can't do taylor series? what a fucking joke

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Is this course enough to satisfy the prerequisites for machine learning and deep learning? (I am referring to the probability and statistics part)

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Board ❤️

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
I have the property 'memorylessness of math concepts'

Whatever happened in the lecture has no bearing on my exam.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Completed till:: 20:00

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Here.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
For those too lazy to read the comments or the notes to this course, THERE IS NO LECTURE 8 because there was an exam administered on that day. The same holds for the OTHER MISSING LECTURES.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
"we only live so long, we can skip that proof" 
wow maybe if my LA prof had the same outlook i would actually remember something from the classes

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
what am I saying... XD

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
do people still use blackboards.?

### 5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines
9:09 start of the lecture

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Came for the Bayesian statistics lecture, stayed for the whole class. Great lectures! thank you

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Absolute legend !

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Jajajajajaa estoy a cuatro grados de conocer a Mónica

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
13:22

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wtf, i learnt this when I was 15. How is MIT one of the best uni in the world??

### 13. Bernoulli Process
Thank you MIT OCW, and thank you Prof Tsitsiklis. Your ability to explain so clearly is truly oustanding.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I find it funny how towards the very end of the lecture, most students hurrying up to get away 😂😂

### 4. Pushdown Automata, Conversion of CFG to PDA and Reverse Conversion
@[USERNAME]Here a student states that NFA and DFA are equivalent. Prof Siper states that this is not true. In the last lecture ( https://youtu.be/KAySmSEGc9U?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60_JNv2MmK3wkOt9syvfQWY&t=56 ) he states this IS true. And in fact we showed that we can model a NFA by using the powerset on the states of a DFA. Even empty strings can be substituted. I was wondering if I got this wrong or whether he just wanted to state that the "general" functionality of a DFA and NFA are different in principal.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Anyone else thinks he talks with the same passion for math, as Walter White does for Chemistry? Love this guy.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
It surprised me that there were only 200k views for this amazing lecture over 10 years.

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
I can imagine that the algorithm where you subtract a1 from all subsequent a would also be much easier to parallelize.

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Erf 😂

### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this video is enormous.45 min?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Brilliant lectures!

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
Audio starts at 1:15

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why are you trolling the introductory lectures of elementary classes then? You're the one choosing the lectures you hear, dumbass.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
many black kids are in MIT. What followed proved my assertion. You could have been more subtle in your argument by veiling your comments discretely. Then you distance the premise by talking about poor whites, meritocracy, etc. Your argument about poor whites is also irrelevant. For centuries, it was gov't policy to exclude blacks from society, not so for poor whites. Now gov't has the MORAL OBLIGATION to assist and include them into society via all the programs available. But, it doesn't matter

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I'm really happy that great lectures are available for free. Young people should appreciate it that they have internet and they can learn from materials from other universities especially from other countries from another part of the globe.

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
Professor Strang ,thank you for a beautiful lecture on minimizing x subject to Ax equal b and the application of the Gram-Schmidt method.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Dr. Strang  is a national treasure.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why did he use the '¿' character?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
p16:34 not so convincing

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What happens when in the region R, for a same value of x there are 3 or more values of y? How does the integral change?

### 34. Final Course Review
No one: Dr. Strang kept the same attire except on 2-3 lectures where he donned the sweater over the shirt.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Superb lecturer! No wonder MIT charges so much lol ;)

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Lots of info loaded

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
You're the best teacher in the world.

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Gilbert Strang + these videos = the beast in Calculus

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Hello ,Area=1/2 Base x Height = 1/2(2x0) x (2Y0)=2xy0,Derivative i.e. 6x^8=48x. Go Fly  a Kite "Sir. My Chemical Engineering Logarthrymic Algebriac-Calculus up here in CANADA, will blow your "mind-away"!!Derivatie ie. 8xy^9=72xy!!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Probably, this has been said before, so forgive me if I repeat someone else's words. 

I acknowledge here, that professor Strang is a good pedagogue. I learnt some math over the years. I completely support the use of the geometrical visualization of some properties, as it is a learning need. I can say that for me it is easy to see how to derive properties like the one he gave for the assignment on the Frobenius norm. I say this, because I may not be the only one thinking it and I wanted to tell those people that there is more to math here. 

Only recently, I understood the huge degree of humility and teaching wit that it takes one to pass one's knowledge along. It requires to pretend or to honestly feel you are no better than any of your students. For instance, as I could witness here, Pr Strang shared with his students the latest cool research topics as if they were his colleagues, he thanked them for contributing to the course by giving out some answers. That's what allows him to successfully challenge them in solving some assignments, like the Frobenius norm - SVD problem. All of it is summarized by Gilbert himself at the very end in 48:12, when he explains his view of his relationship with the students (such as "We have worked to do!", an honest use of the pronoun "we" by the lecturer). 

This 48 min long lecture, honestly impressed me in this regard. Today, I had the privilege of a double lecture: one in math (that could have been compressed to 15 min, since most proofs were skipped) and one in being a better passer of knowledge (that could be extended to 10+ years). Hat off!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
french  is so hhhhh

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
multi-variable was easy. I am a bussiness major but decided to take the class cuz i was bored. Didn't even go to lecture one time still managed an A+

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Lets says  I have  two vectors (1,2,4) and (3,y,z) how to get the cartesian equation like ax + by + cz + d = 0 ?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I love Math!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
1:10:29
X_i follows gaussian(or normal) distribution

### Lecture 13: Limits of Functions
Amazing lecture learned a lot!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
and the most boring teacher award of the day goes to.....

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This is a great series as so much of understanding math comes from the instructor's ability to convey the material in an understandable way.  I have a very intelligent instructor at my university, but he does not take an intuitive, step by step approach.  Many students are therefore left scratching their heads and trying to make sense of the text, which is bad enough.  These videos have been invaluable to me.  Thanks for posting them!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
this lecture is so helpful

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
why is everyone laughing?  is it at his accent?

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
Gil has been my math professor for the last 12 years. These online courses are so amazing.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
36:20  "I quit without trying, I shouldn't have done that." So true

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
are proofs taught in some other class, or are they not relevant for the course at MIT?

### 34. Final Course Review
those first words "the final class in linear algebra at MIT this fall" makes you feel nostalgic already :'(

### 15. Poisson Process II
Цікавий "парадокс". Слухав із задоволенням. Дякую!

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
This is the best lecture I have ever listed to. Thank you Professor.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition

I actually walked by his current office. He's on the top floor of the math department of UC Berkeley if you're interested.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]so he plugged in the WHOLE term, which was multiplied with X - Xo, to the derivative formula?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i am only a high school student studying pure maths, but idk why the students in MIT ask stupid questions that even i can answer... and yet, many smarter people out there can't get in:(

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this should be called mr. rogers teaches mathematics

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Wow all the concepts make so much more sense now. Dr. Strang really is a great teacher!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
would just love to make a small addition to the theorem, just an intuative way to look at it is, there is no tangent to a point but there is a definite tangent to a point on a curve, hence the theorem must be correct, hope i make sense :)

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]First: When he says that y=x^2, he's talking about the Magnitude of x squared, not the unit squared. Here is an example: Imagine I have a sheet of paper whose width is 10 cm and its length is the width squared. The length will then be 100 cm, NOT 100 cm^2 right? This is because only the magnitude (the number itself) was squared, not the unit. The same thing happens with the problem he's solving. 

### 12. Iterated Expectations

Wow this is the end

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
So far exactly what I need. A note: This is a hybrid of algebra and statistics so you may rewrite  A as X, b as y, and x as b. This has helped me relate the presented material to associated material in the statistical literature.

It feels that the right side is louder than the left. Anyone feels the same?

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
For BPP, deep learning and for the general structure of neural networks the following comments may be useful. 

To begin with, note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

It is also possible to look at the networks in a more structured manner. The basic ideas of BPP can then be applied in much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

### Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers
1:06:49 when he wrote "b is an upper bound for -A", I'm pretty sure he meant "-b is an upper bound for -A", since b is actually the lower bound for A.

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Great courses! Thanks from France!


### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
at @29:31 he says the rate of change is supposed to determine a function upto this "starting value". I didn't the meaning and significance of starting value , and he is referring to.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
I cant understand why avg (divf) in D= avg(-u sub t) in D ,then Divf= -u sub t? Because if we actually plug a coordintate in the equation, it is no guaranteed the equation will be true.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
1:14:30
Omg I must say this class is a delight specially the sigma part. I was so surprised. Maybe it is something simple but it wasnt for me because I always Just use the equation.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
Great teacher.

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
At 31:44 
in order to find the dimension of subspace S, Prof Strang takes A as [1 1 1 1] of which S is null space.

My question is, we could have taken A as 4 * 4 identity matrix for which S  would have acted as null space.
In that case rank(A) is 4 and hence no free variable thus its null space which is S has (4-4) 0 dimension
So why are we restricted to take A as [1 1 1 1] in which case the dimension of S comes out to be 3 as rank(A) = 1 ?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]you realize less than 10% of freshman are in this course. This is the lowest level math offered at MIT. 

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
At 45:20, if we are talking about null space then indeed there would be an infinite number of solutions, but if we are talking about Ax=b then there needs to be a particular solution in the first place for the infinite solutions to be existing. 
Am I right?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Another mistake at 44.20. it only makes sense talking about the continuity of a function in a value that belongs to the domain of that function. f(x)= Sin(x)/x is continuos in all the domain R-{0}.

Thank you very much! Amazing lectures!

Mit's beauty

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
excellent

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
VERY crappy,  A WASTE OF TIME, and i spent too much hours in this lecture but still cannot get in.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Prof Strang is mathematical elegant in delivering linear algebra in an understandable way

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
The meat begins at 12:00.
05:30 Errr, no, the square is not "made of" points. It *contains* those points. A point just marks a certain location inside that (pre-existing) square. One _cannot_ build the area of the square from points, because POINTS DON'T HAVE ANY AREA BY THEMSELVES!!! Areas could be made only from smaller (e.g. unit) areas. Otherwise there would be no difference between a scalar, a vector, a pseudovector, and a pseudoscalar in Clifford Algebras etc. There's a reason we distinguish those dimensions, right? :P
The ridiculousness of that statement comes out nicely at 06:10 where he writes the sum of the probabilities for these points. He said in the previous lecture that the probability of a point is 0 (because it has no area, and we assumed that area = probability in this model), and he restated this assumption again in this lecture here. So we're actually *adding up 0s here*! And we _cannot_ get a positive result (in this case: 1) from summing up zeros, no matter how much of them we add up (be it 10, 100 or infinitely many). So the right side of this equation cannot be equal to the left side, and the entire equation is false.
06:40 No, the mistake is not in this point. The union is fine, as long as we're adding up actual areas. The mistake is in assuming that a point can have an area :P
07:20 Of course I can! Cantor's diagonalization argument is one example. Another one is Hilbert's space-filling curve. Long story short: yes, there are ways of ordering points on a surface, as well as in space, by threading them on a line. In other words, there exist functions which map points on a surface (or in space) onto a line. And this is another proof that this is not what is wrong with this argument. The "points have area" assumption is.
17:20 If the probability of B is 0, then we're contradicting ourselves, because the "|B" in "P(A|B)" was supposed to mean that B occurred *for sure*. So it _cannot_ be 0! The very statement that "B occurred" means that this probability is _not_ 0, and we are OK to put it in the denominator. Logic, Mr. Titskills :P

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
39:05 This is it. Weighting definitions are where the magic lies.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
In a traditional multivariable calculus class, the concept of Hessian matrix will be introduced at this point.  I wonder why he doesn't.

Anyway, a Hessian matrix of 2 variables is just a matrix of [ fxx fxy; fxy fyy ].  Let D = det(H), then:
1) If D < 0, saddle point
2) If D > 0, either relative min or max.  Furthermore, if fxx  > 0, then it's relative min.  If fxx < 0, it's a relative max.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
thank you sir...

### 14. Poisson Process I
Excellent explanation !

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Honestly I think there should be people moderating the comments section that delete those judgmental comments. The students have rights to learn in a safe environment. Asking “stupid” questions is an integral part of learning as much as making mistakes. It’s just sad to see students swallow their doubts bcs they worry about how they look in front of others.
So if you know the answers to the questions, shut up and watch the video without being a judgmental jerk.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I used this to self-learn Vector calculus in my summer finishing year-1 of basic Multi-Calc in college starting from Lesson-15 to Lesson-29. I also made use of Schaum's Vector Analysis for problems and SJ Colley's Vector Calc as an additional reference. I watched all vids in at min 1.25x finishing it up in 2 weeks time.
 
Dennis Auroux is an absolutely delight and his board-rubbing skills are sooo impressive! His explanations are spectacular & I really enjoyed his emphasis on applications (particularly from physics-inertia, maxwell's eqns etc).

One thing I missed was lack of info on the Frenet-Serret Equations which I found awesome in general & the lack of practicing more problems but hey, you could do both on your own like I did!

Anyways, 12 years after this vid has been released, I'd still recommend this course with all my heart. It is awesome! Thanks MIT for releasing this to the public & thanks Prof. Auroux for just being an amazing lecturer!

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
I really encourage you to buy The Introduction of Linear Algebra which Pf Strang wrote. If I say these videos are rank r, then I can definitely say the book is the orthogonal complement of these videos that makes perfect dimension of Linear Algebra.

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Jerison is only comparing the highest degree terms in both the numerator (1) and the denominator (1/x), because that's all that matters when the limit approaches infinity. And yes, the factor does disappear to zero, after that comparison is made. He's just eliminated the rest of the terms in advance because they're irrelevant when x approaches infinity.

Why is it not a crime yet to not teach like this in high school?

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Damn easy.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I think just plotting a vector on new axes with reference to a given axes.
New axes not necessarily orthogonal to each other.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
46:08 It should be F_100 is similar to c_1 * lambda1 * x_1. The professor missed x_1 here. But if you assume x_1 is 1 (which is the case here), then this is correct.

I Really Like The Video Dot product From Your

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
If I replace u => Sc, I get d/dt Sc = A Sc. But, at 30:20, he gets S d/dt c = A Sc. Did he say anywhere that d/dx and S commute?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
What happens if you had: only 10 people in this particular class, would everybody eventually be happy?

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Thank You Professor!!! 


### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why they hate Taylor's approx tho? I think that's so cool

### 34. Final Course Review
 
Thanks Prof. Strang and IMT for sharing these lectures.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
his english is absolutely flawless. just has a thick accent which makes him seem even more intelligent, almost as if he mastered english overnight

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
So many questions answered in 40 minutes. Thank you so much, Professor Strang.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Very astute remark.
If you are going to eat  a lot of cream cheese you will say it the same way.

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
thanks a lot. great job!

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes, please upload the rest of this. Seen the first 12 lectures and they are really great. Want to see the rest since I missed most of my own single variable calculus lectures, and I want to really master the basics.

And how great it feels to learn college level stuff from another side of earth. Really love this. This is the future. Education for anyone who wants it.

Go MIT! from Sweden.

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
A good class! Thanks for all your effect(Thank teacher extra)!

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Haar wavelet
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
"the vast majority" someone came into MIT with out having to us vectors, damn you universe, with out it Physics is just a 10th grade math lesson. 

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
@28:35, the set of vectors given are not a basis. They don't span R^3 since the nullspace corresponding to those vectors have a common form: [c,-2c,c] which is not only the zero vector. But however, the intended idea is clear from whatever he has explained :)

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Excellent lecture. Professor Strang is a legend.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
At 41min, Why is the number of nonzero eigenvalues the same as rank(A)?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
His lecture make me cry.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Hi, at 39:00 how did he so quickly find the roots of the equation?

### 16. Markov Chains I
Great! Thanks.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
This lecture was pretty confusing

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He just simplified the algebra of it a little. He could have wrote u(X + deltaX)/v(X + deltaX) instead, more like the previous deduction of the product rule. However recall that u(X + deltaX) - u(X) = deltaU, and since we are missing the -u(X) term, u(X + deltaX) = deltaU(X) PLUS u(x). Hence as written, u + deltaU. 

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am not so familiar with the US education system, but isn't this 9th grade level calculus?

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Not impressed so far. Prof. Auroux does not do a good job on explaining the details, e.g.: he explains that the dot product for 2 vectors <x,y,z>*<a,b,c> = a*x + b*y + c*z, but does not explain that the orthogonal components that are multiplied in this dot product result in zero. The dot product <x,y,z>*<a,b,c>  is actually

a*x*cos(0) + b*x*cos(90) + z*x*cos(90) + a*y*cos(90) + b*y*cos(0) + c*y*cos(90) + a*z*cos(90) + b*z*cos(90) + c*z*cos(0) = a*x + b*y + c*z

All too often math teachers jump over steps that they consider trivial, but these jumps can be rather confusing for the student! Combine this with students' lack of (ability for) disciplined thinking and/or having gotten lost at an early stage, and you have the reasons why so many people fail at math.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
16:20:"where did he put his good god white foot on lol🤣"

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
game over ! (Pi / 8)*4 =Pi /2 so our teacher says that a cercle'area of 1 for radius, is Pi/2, game over, the answer it's PI

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thank you MIT
Also, the accent his so cool

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great videos. Explains much better than my prof. 

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
how do we know that E-1 will be a lower triangular matrix?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thank u sir

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
These people are a stand-up comedian's wet dream.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]I don't want to come off as an ultimate smarthead, but I have been asking myself the very same question for quite some time now...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The plural of Formula is Formulae
Aiio.


### Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I found another solution : y=-ln(abs(x))/2a+c, where the parabolas are y=ax^2

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
"I think of these matrices as people". thank you so much professor to making me feel the same.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
thank u prof Auroux and MIT

### Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Great instructor. The materials are well organized, and the lectures are really helpful and enlightening. Thanks a lot!

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Time 39.20, vector v and r are always changing as planet rotate around the Sun.  How does he know abs (r cross v) = constant?  He is using the law to justify it's a constant.   It should be the other way around,  we need to understand why it's a constant in order to justify the law.  So why is it a constant?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
@[USERNAME], he says that he just adds it to create a system of equations. 

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Give this man a medal

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Listening to cinematic musics while watching the lecture makes me feel like I'm in a top secret project and I'm the most important agent

### 19. Principal Component Analysis
47:25 bottom left: How is Var(u^TX)defined? What does the "variance" of a random vector mean? Thank you so much

### 34. Final Course Review
A thanks from me as well. I've really enjoyed this series, and have thoroughly learned linear algebra, which is now my favorite branch of math.

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
sir is lec 8 not there?

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
100× 100 matrix will take max  49950 steps of ellimination to form an Identity , if and only if -> all the elements are not equal 0 ;  explanation -formula as per me 😁 i.e  100 × 100  matrix = 10000 elements  , so 100 num of pivots , which are no to be changed  and so remaining  elements ;10000-100 = 99900  ; we are supposed to make either upper or a lower Tri. , So now we  have to change 1/2 of the  elements skipping the pivots i.e = 1/2 × 99900 = 49950 elements  so 49950 steps 😎

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Is it necessary through all Lectures for Machine learning preparation?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Dr prof yes yes yes MIT the best because they make difficult things easy hehehehe

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
great vid sweet on my ears.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
IN the last proof how did f(X0) get included into the limit in the next line ? can anyone explain please?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
dont assume that his life is consumed by this... he has math skills with exceptional social skills which is extremely rare in scientists... which simply put just means that he is a genius...

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Great lecture, really concise. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love this guy. He would deserve a 'Gilbert Strang fan club'.

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
Yufei Zhang is a legend

### Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!
Note: Videos of Lectures 28 and 29 are not available because those were in-class lab sessions that were not recorded.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Greatest of teachers inspire the students to fall in love with learning

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
While I have little clue as to what he is talking about, I have to say that this lecturer speaks well.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Gotta love when the golden ratio shows up out of nowhere

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24:40 a Physicist walks into a math lecture

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Respect for 9th graders watching this

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The introduced concepts are much simpler than the way they are presented in this lecture.

### 8. Undecidability
Mit, I request in comment to mit every time and thanks they provide it. Please complete the algorithm trioglogy 6.854 please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Intuitively, a positive definite matrix is one that has more stretching weight than a rotation weight. If it operates on a vector in the first quadrant, it guarantees that the output vector is also in the first quadrant. This is almost like a closure property under the transformation of a matrix. I need to examine the case when the x vector in Ax is not in the first quadrant. The entire underlying theme is creating something that is very close to an Eigen matrix with more weight around the diagonal. The important of Eigen matrices is well known in applications where the power matrix has the same effect of a power scalar function. With big matrices, there is nothing more valuable than decomposing a matrix in terms of simpler matrices among which the Eigen matrix is one of those decompositions. Diagonalizing a matrix and SVD is very related to this theme. Any analysis that attempts to transform the effect of a matrix to one that resembles a scalar transformation is the goal.

### Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule
Thank you very much for this interesting presentation.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
the whole lecture was incredible.
godlike.
gausslike.
stranglike..!!!!!!!!!!!!


### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
A_s = A screwed up.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Use beta function to solve at 38:45

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Professor Strang can almost always explain a concept from an angle other professors rarely touch upon. Excitingly, that angle seems always to be the right angle most appropriate to understand that concept.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
studying for calc 3 before i even take it...

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
i love how at the end he keeps nodding his head for the video to end xD

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I find this lecture little chaotic.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
For those of you who don't understand this lecture, read this notes https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/2.-partial-derivatives/part-b-chain-rule-gradient-and-directional-derivatives/session-38-directional-derivatives/MIT18_02SC_notes_20.pdf

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]why wouldn't you cheer? (o.O) 
it's just a thing their students have been doing since 18.01, they get bored i guess...

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
It is better not to rotate when getting ellipse. Ellipse has to be done without rotating, because multipling by lambda makes stretching along axes. Then of course should be rotating by matrix U. I.e. when ellipse first appeared on the board it should be vertically placed, not inclined.
It is possible to draw - you should placed vectors 1 and 2 inclined initially on the first step. Then after multipling by V they will be along axes. Then stretching, then once again rotating. Still, it is a good lecture! :)

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
At 15:34.  Did he make a mistake here?  The two normalized vectors 1/3(1, 2, 2) and 1/3(-2, -1, 2) aren't orthonormal because their inner product is not zero.  It is 1/3(1*-2 + 2*-1 + 2*2) = 4/3.

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
Thanks so much..it has been too many times I followed the lectures...still not bored.

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
The best lecture Ive ever seen, Thank you very much!!!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
An Indian edition of this book is available only in India
http://www.wellesleypublishers.com/buy.html

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i really don't get the rotation bit at around 45:00. ive been staring at it for like 5m at this point.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
After all that and he did not explicitly state that e^ix = cos(x) + i*sin(x) what a shame.

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
That seems to be the Google's video about T-SNE that prof. Rigollet mentions in 3:16 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsE8jm1GzE

Not so illustrated. A lot of notions are not clearly defined

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"oh, did I just invent a negative one?" - made me laugh =)

Love these lectures, very well explained and at a comfortable pace. Thank you for this.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Great lecture Professor Tsitsiklis,  very clear, pretty neat as well as the ones from your TA´s.  I am following MIT OpenCourseWare.

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
im really glad MIT put up these series. im about to go into college and the summer breka and all gave me a chance to learn more classes, like single variable calculus which was fairly easy. but now that im learning this, I found that I had to really change my perspectve on certain fields of mathematics, particularily linear algebra. the whole beginning of the series with vectors took me a while to understand because id never thought of systems of equations in that way. 

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
guys i have a question

Can i differentate this and say
First derivative of f (x)   >=   2*x  ?
Please i need help on this one

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Damn!!!was eagerly waiting for these lectures!!!!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank u for the awesome lectures

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
e^x and ln x are inverse functions. Their approximations are also inverse functions. Is this true for all invertible functions?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh, they make things so much simpler at good schools where people are smarter and have an easier time making connections that are actually not that obvious.

Like I didn't get any explanation about the intuitive aspect of dot product in my classes...

-.-

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
is there one who know this guy's accent

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Derivative 10-11th form in Russia . Easy-peasy piece of cake  

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
guys if you are here because of machine learning then trust me this course is the most most useful one to do before even starting machine learning i can ensue you it worth it 100% i myself have completed this series and it just gave me leg up in ML trust me after this course you will be able to understand ml concept that some of highly paid ML people can't! it will be such a leg up in you ml career i swear i wish i can erase it from my memory and do all it all over again 
p.s please do it right tho understand every concept go through book and do exercise if needed give it good 3 months atleast

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Of course I know how to use it, but I once didn't. Same goes for you. Which is why you shouldn't think people who don't know how to use this method are stupid.

Prof: laughs slightly


Me: NO NO NO, please say no

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Fantastic! But it's better to relate math to physics.

screw the chalk, i have money! (ygotas reference)

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
From about 20:00 onward the professor didn't explain clearly how he switched dx.dy to r.dr.d(theta).
Could anybody help me? I mean, show me step by step.
I'd get so thankful.[iminent=aqC6F9gUWfOB] 
Noble atitudes deserve recognising.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Imagine being late for a lecture and becoming famous in the web because of it after thousands watch that lecture on YouTube. I think this is what accidentally happens here.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Very comprehensive. Thanks

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
Put on socks > put on shoes, thus to inverse the process take of shoes > take of socks 😂 Great analogy!

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

### Lecture 14: Limits of Functions in Terms of Sequences and Continuity
@[USERNAME]OpenCourseWare  will the 13 lecture be uploaded soon ?

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
In the KL divergence near the end, there's a step that was mentioned quite quickly which went from the expectation of the logs to the average of the logs by the law of large numbers, and n seems to have been introduced. Am I right in saying that the average is after taking n samples, sampled according to the theta star distribution?

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
integration of 1/x^2+2x+3 is =1/2^1/2 tan inverse of x+1/2^1/2

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
thank you MIT, all these linear algebra lectures are very helpful, and Prof. Gilbert Strang teach very well

thank you very much!!:))


### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
This lecture taught the algorithm but did not explain or prove why it will work... Anybody know where I can find the proof?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
a beautiful person.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Quality matters!! ❤️
Awesome professor. Thanks MIT for this...

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good observation.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
27:13 I understand you can throw away column 3 because it's the addition of other two columns, but how can you throw away column 1??

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
There are very few instances in which I did have difficulty in understanding
what Prof. Tsitsiklis is saying ...

one of them is -- 

21:48: There is going to be a fair amount of probability that Y takes the value close to 0.
Why ? Can someone please explain to me ...

Anyways, these are some of the best (and rigorous) lectures on Probability on youtube. I just love them.
Prof. Tsitsiklis and his team of TA's show their complete dedication to deliver this outstanding content, which is commendable.
Their commitment and dedication made contribute small funds to MIT OCW for furthering the cause of MIT to spread
education to masses.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
There must be a really attractive girl in the front row because he keeps winking even in this video.

### 3. Independence
The professor did a good job of explaining these concepts so that they seem intuitive :) Thanks!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
is it 14:40 there is a mistake? should it be perpendicular to the line not vertical distance to the line?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Anyone else likes to watch those in speed x1.5 ?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really wish there was a higher resolution or a new version. I have to concentrate hard to see some of the stuff.

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
What if Mr Strang has to take square root of r

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Was launching matlab to play fifteen, prof immediately speaks of matlab. How did you know 11 years prior!?

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof. Strang.
It was wonderful learning from you!

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well...im a greek student and I study economics in University of Patra... The lesson could be way more easy,if we had this equipment and not based only on what the teacher wrote on the board

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Curve sketching is at 30:35

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
“Just a sec”😂

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks, dear Sir

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
How the fuck did these students get into mit, the educational system is so fucked up!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
Awesome!

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
At 5:45 finding derivative of inverse matrix A looks too complicated. It should be much simpler by starting from inv(A)*A=I and then simply applying chain rule. This leads to d(inv(A))/dt * A+inv(A) * dA/dt = 0. From this, the solution is obvious.

### 7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing
These lectures are amazing. For people like me working in related industry, I also recommend the book of "trustworthy online controlled experiments" as a companion book to these lectures (lectures 7-12) to gain a deeper understanding how these concepts are applied to real world product and business problems.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
💖💖💖🙏

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
What kind of chalk does MIT use? It looks like they write and erase so easily!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
sure it's rudimentary, but it's certainly not taught the same everywhere. Teachers are different. I remember my teacher and he couldnt even compare to this guy. It's the matter of preparation and speaking skill.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Prof Leonard is way better

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
well, think of it this way: The control of mathematics is allowing you to view this youtube video right now. All technology is based on math. If you control mathematics, you in a sense control the future, and yes that's pretty fucking cool.

### Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences
53:33 is a little confusing to me.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 23:05 kid in red shirt isn't sure of answer....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
in hong kong or china.. we learn it in 10th grade(sec. 4)= =
do they learn it in university?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
well duh, someone spelled out how build a triangle out of paper like they do in your classes i'd know how to do it too.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Fast fourier transform part was too tough for me

### Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series
17:27 he said if you find a limit along a subsequence. This subsequence is not defined and is very miss-leading for me.

Gilbert strang a great math teacher............

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes, he does.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This lecture of sprang has inspired me to initiate a collision point of two planes that moves at the same speed same altitude that point that was forbidden by the two pilots perhaps an outside topological information whether the gradient points that is moved by the landing plane is within the perfect landing boundary for a safe landing with the locking gear opened for timely landing and the angle of gracing may be evaluated by Prof.Sprang's plane of analysis.The plane may be auto stimulated by the laser gracing angle fitted in front of Goose Neck emitter.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
watched for 1hr and learned nothing. Nice job, MIT, I'm out

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
I didn’t really got this now but I will review previous material to finally understand this lecture!!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
People are probably going to hate this comment but I thought his lecture was a little bit disorganized. It's clear that he knows his subject but I think he needs to develop everything one step at a time and not be in such a rush.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This Prof's handwriting is unbelievable. It's SO neat!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Student in a blue shirt at front is sleeping 😴 what a waste of an opportunity.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
It is better than Chinese mathematic class!

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To be honest though, i learnt calculus in france through highschool and university and i've never heard them call an integral : "somme", they call a sum "somme" and an integral is intégrale and antiderivative: primitive..
Weird because he does know what he's talking about. Maybe they used to call it that way a long time ago, but not anymore.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So Smiley You Make Available This Video Arc Length Surface Area and My Favourite the Parametric Equation

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Brilliant!  Great presentation.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Regarding the problem at 26:28
It would be solved if the matrix U was [1 0; 0 -1]. (Replace the 1 at the bottom right of the 2x2 identity with -1).
This can be found by following the argument that Prof Strang makes in this video: https://youtu.be/rYz83XPxiZo?t=1177 (Skip to 19:37).  
The problem is that here the eigenvectors of U that we found are [1, 0]' and [0, 1]', but they should be [1, 0]' and [0, -1]'.
The negative in the 2nd eigenvector allows the scaling term (sigma) to be strictly positive.  

Let S = Sigma (for ease of typing).
I think the main problem is that the general form A = U*S*V' does not mathematically enforce that S should be a strictly positive matrix.
So even though A'A and AA' will output the squares of the eigenvalues, simply choosing the positive roots is not enough.
We would need to choose the right sign for the eigenvector that corresponds to the positive root. E.g. [1,0] and [-1,0] can both have the same eigenvalue, so we have to decide which to use.
Hence, we need to check the cases and manually negate the vectors in U or V so that S can be positive.
However, if we follow what Prof Strang does in the video whose URL ive included in the earlier part of this comment, then this is accounted for by the computation.

### 12. Time Complexity
Wolfgang J. Paul, if you are here: make homework and exams easier!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Don't worry if you have a good teacher, only worry if you have a teacher who has never heard of calculus before lol.  That might be a slight problem.  
Will you be taking the AP exam?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm too dumb for this. I'm sure if I learned it, I would understand it, but math isn't my thing. I try and try and even that isn't enough. It is enough to get me a C every year I had in high school math. I'm a Senior now, taking pre-calc and it's easier than my other maths, but I think it's only because we've been working on the same things for almost a whole semester!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
24:51 seriously? Basic LCM is a doubt in an MIT class?

### 24. Classical Inference II
This class is essentially week one of a Machine Learning class XD

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I was literally shocked when students asked que for 1 q

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Wait, this was published 4 days before I decided I needed this? Thank you!

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
i think there is a very small mistake in the graph of (a_i*x-b)^2. The confusion area is bound is not a_i/b_i but b_i/a_i

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
what on earth are they talking about? This makes no sense.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
you'd figure mit would use markerboards and not chalkboards

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
If Plato was right about theory of forms I'm pretty sure that this is the IDEAL lecture.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like it!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Max ||Ax||/||x||=Max ||Akx||/||kx||=Max ||Ax||/||x||, ||x||=1.
So you can think of a unit circle ||x||=1 with ||Ax|| plotted on the radius which might look like a circle and ellipse with a point on the Ellipse being at Max ||Ax||/||x||.

Why the camera is wobbling? Why not focusing on the board? more distractions

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
13:22 , lucky to sleep in mit lecture hall

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
Just a clarification.  Dr. Strang got a bit confused while testing the convergence rate to solution 3 (in his example) and was wondering about -3 solution, blowing up etc...  He should have remembered that he was testing CR for solution 3 by subtracting 3 from both sides of Xk+1 equation.  To test the other solution (-3), he would have subtracted -3 from both sides or adding 3 to both sides and that would have yielded (1/2Xk)(Xk+3)^2.

### Lecture 16: The Min/Max Theorem and Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem
To do the negation he used a direct proof with contradiction

### Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
it'd be interesting to see how topology is used to convert a general domain to simply connected regions.  Amazing how youtube/Mooc has totally changed education. no need to pay 50K a year  to acquire the same knowledge.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
love u professor

### 34. Final Course Review
it took a lot of time but i finally finished this series. Thank you, Professor Strang!  You are a wonderful teacher and an inspiration.

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Conclusion: A set of orthonormal vectors combine into a matrix called Q. Q'Q always get an identity matrix. If Q is square, it's an orthogonal matrix, and Q'=Q^(-1). If we use Qx=b instead of Ax=b to solve the projection problem, it will be much easier. Because the projection matrix P=Q(Q'Q)^(-1)Q'=QQ'.
For the A'Ax=A'b problem, if we use Q instead of 'A' we can simplify it as x hat equal to Q'b. 
Gram-Schmidt method: A way to transform independent column vectors into orthonormal basis.
A=QR => Q^(-1)A=Q(-1)QR => Q'A=R

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This is awesome. We use the fourth edition of Dr. Strang's Intro to Linear Algebra in class and I am so glad these videos are available online. I found vector spaces to be a tricky topic in class, via my notes, even in the book. This lecture was executed beautifully. Makes so much more sense now. I am definitely the type of learner who really needs to have a deep understanding for the concepts to stick. Thanks so much!

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Can someone please explain why the condition for pivot test is (ac-b^2)/a > 0? If I just do the elimination to figure out the pivot, shouldn't the second pivot just be （c-b^2)/a?

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
4:02, you would think that people at MIT would have this down by now 
still a good lecture though

### Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator
Great lecture but unfortunately it got ruined by the stupid robot filming it

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Difficult class. Reasonable questions but feels like "Bueller? Bueller?"

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
The eigenvectors of A should have been [1/(lambda - 1), 1], not [lambda, 1] as the professor wrote. He of course had the right idea but computationally, the result is simply wrong. Happens, still a great lecture! I know how to solve difference equations using multidimensional finite element method, but this approach by generating a matrix system and solving via eigenstuffs is new to me. Thank you for opening my mind! ☺️ This channel is making me a better dropout day by day lol

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
High and low are relative terms. If you *want* to hit your little brother with a dart, then yeah, 1% is subjectively low, but in probability questions that deal with risk of bodily harm like this, 1%  is unacceptably high.

Similar if trying to find probability that a new medicine will have a fatal side-effect. Even if the chance of death is .001% - that still means that if one million people take the drug, you'd expect ten people to die from it. Are ten people dying too high or too low to you?

That is why MIT is MIT,
Thanks professor.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
The fact that he is talking about spaces and somehow he is unable to manage tha space of the board is so very funny! I love this guy; the way he chooses his words is so proper, everything gets clear...Regards and respect from Greece mr Strang.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
fantastic

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wait how did they know that the area of e^(-x^2) from 0 to infinity is sqrt(pi)/2?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Here I was, thinking I was gonna breeze through this lecture when BAM! I got hit with subtle logic 👨🏽‍🏫

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
It is for students in university right?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why a chalk board...

### 25. Classical Inference III
best applied prob course out there for free

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
How can you use right pseudo-inverse to solve Ax = b?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
These recitations are actually very good. It is helpful to quickly revise the concepts.

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
I think that in 21:40 it should say "For all e > e' > 0" Or something of that nature. Otherwise there is not connection between e and e'.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
About 19:55 minutes in to subject.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
google OCW MIT and name of course


### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

### 4. Counting
the part of n choose k  is  a brilliant explaination.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha, déjà vu. He's at UCB now teaching Math 53 (multivariable calculus) and his lectures are pretty much the same as this =D

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
And hot do I use this in real life?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I think the best title for this video is Understanding Null Space. 

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
https://j.gifs.com/0VrmQ7.gif 

Dahh.. He is still there

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
Great analogy of infinite basis for functions

u are worldclass...u are better than any german docent..

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
THANK YOU SO MUCH MIT, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS...

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
My god this is so beautiful. So much insight making things fall into place. "Finding coefficienes in a Fourrier series is exactly like an expansion in an orthonormal basis". Now I get it!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone have a favorite Calculus textbook? (Or several?)

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
You guys should really really give the time for when the actual lecture starts past the administrative stuff

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Definitely it was a great decision to close the lecture with Kepler's law example. IMHO, it is always good (when possible) to exercise a physics example along with the math topic in question.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
The taste is different with MIT people! You "feel" the science with them! I envy the ones who had the opportunity to sit in these class rooms!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The only way to explain that is by using Euclid's elements ... otherwise you get stuck in the arguments ... observe that he is trying to explain the Euclid's element without actually mention it ... I do not know why ...

### 3. Independence
If only probability questions had half the clarity in their information as the way Professor talks..!

As he mentioned at the end, it is very easy to get confused while solving the probability questions based on real situations because the information provided can easily have multiple interpretations if utmost clarity is not maintained.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Jai subbu

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Being quite about matrix multiplication about rest of the day is what i need at min 20. This guy know how to make a good joke and being helpful with it. Thanks Strang!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Prof Gilbert String moves me from "need to" to "want to" learn Math. Thank you so much!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
@[USERNAME]that sucks...how are we supposed to get those..by guessing?

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
This  is the first that I heard  the terms Wavelets and Image Compression in the same lecture when it comes to linear algebra. Wavelets  and Image Technology have been changing things that we  used in this world over the past few years. From fingerprints to camera technology, this is how linear  algebra impacts real life.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
he's gonna kill all of them, what an assassin:D

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
thank you MIT OCW for sharing such wonderful knowledge with detail explanation, for those who are not able to get source to learn things, it is really very great and awesome platform. thank you!

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
mn . np = mp

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
respect sir !

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Two people go to Harvard...

### Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property
Comment on the liar analogy:  liars do not feel bound by logic always to make false statements.  Liars lie when it suits them.  Case in point:  Trump.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
To those confused with why y's units need not be consistent with x's units:

say, the population of rabbits grows exponentially with time that:
where A is the initial number of rabbits,
Y is the final number of rabbits,
Y= A^t.

So are we saying we should say the number of rabbits at time t should have units rabbits^time? No, rabbits are still counted in rabbits.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
What a teacher.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
2019-09-17 02:27:12

Thank you Prof. Strang, I wish you all the best

My right ear learned a lot from this lecture.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Really useful, thanks:)﻿

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
Which book the professor is talking about? 12:19

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]what about it? I don't see anything bad in that. It doesn't effect the teaching so what's the harm?

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
20:14 What's example that elements of basis are not orthogonal?

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
This video is gold, not everyone gets the fact.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
oh God the distractions.

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Y=x^2  NO!. Meters does not equal meters squared.  Try Y=kx^2  where k is a unit conversion factor ie 1/(1meter).In cm,  the k would be 1/(100cm)  Make SURE your equation is dimensionally correct BEFORE you work with it.  The constant k also appears in the answer making volume be in meters cubed (or cm cubed) as volume should be.  This lecture was a mess and should be redone!

### 16. Markov Chains I
excellent!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
How are their so many empty chairs? I would die for an opportunity to listen his video live

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He's a little boy genius (accademically speaking) , he had 2 BSc in maths and physics (1st class)  by the age of 17!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
for det( A + B ) = ? there is no formula....

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
I was using the first edition of his book in 1982/83.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
And the title of one of the book of MIT was surprising for me, it made me unhappy, now I have to pretend (like some antik philosopher) that nothing existed before me, but that will make them unhappy too. (I met even someone that said because I learned english, everything and anything that I say is hot from me!!!!)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
My heartfelt thanks to Prof. Strang. You have been forever immortalized in the minds of students by your stupendous teaching!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
You know a man's the GOAT if lectures from almost 2 decades ago with chalk and a blackboard are better than 90% of the content online. Thank You, Professor Strang and MIT for bringing such amazing content to the world...

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
If only my textbook had been like this

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
what is the best book or resource to learn the whole mathematics behind stochastic gradient descent?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
thanks ...

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Gauss be with you Gilbert

### 9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems
Thanks for the lecture! I've tried to learn these things before and gotten out more confused than I was when I came in, but Dr. Strang's approach makes it all seem so simple!

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
This problem has been over-flogged by the learned Prof. The simple answer (from linear algebra standpoint) is the projection of the origin onto the multilinear SET:  { Ax = b }.  This would almost always yield  the invertible matrix  A*At, such that the solution of: (A*At)y = b. Which you then plug into the given constraint to get:
x = At.y  which is the solution to the problem. A need not be a square matrix for all the respective dimensions to match. This particular form of the solution coincides with the projection of the point [ x = 0] onto the linear subspace: { x | Ax = b }. This is infact a trivial problem since we can project any other points e.g. x = (1, 2, 3,...., n ), onto { Ax = b } to arrive at yet another point on this subspace. This problem can also be viewed from linear analysis standpoint where the vector function: f(x,t) = ||x||^2 - t(Ax - b) is being minimized, wrt the vector x. And the same result is found. Cheers.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He teach too fast.. I guess im so stupid i can't follow him LOL! 

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
do you even lift

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
His explanations have always been impeccable. What a legend.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
I agree, it's really just an issue of ego, which everyone seems to gain too much of when going to college. 

Once they lose their ego, they might actually learn something. 

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Limits, continuity

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
جدو جلبرت ❤️

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Excellent courses from the comfort of your home..

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Meh perhaps most of them are first years, and this class lasts only one semester anyway, there to make sure everyone has the basics down.

Eitherway, why the hell do you care, and if this stuff is below you, why are you watching it?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
2:43 Why disturb Siri after midnight?

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you soooooooo much, prof Auroux and MIT for making this course available to everyone.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is a Scam

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Great explanation

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Why does he do 1/root2 at 11:00?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This professor is so wordy

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
HAHA.... everyone chose 1 for the 1st question. LOL!!!!!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
one question:
why the nullspace 

    | 1 |
c  | 1 |
    | -1|

passing through the origin is a line and not a plane?
Can anyone help me with this.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That is one of my most elegant proof of the fundamental theorem of line integrals I've ever seen. 

### Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...
21:49 wrong conclusion. What you have is a subsequence of <Au_n,u_n> that converges to either ||A|| or -||A||. The sequence <Au_n,u_n> itself may not converge.

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
@[USERNAME]Why'd he have the chalk in his pocket?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love you so much MIT!!!

### Lecture 17: Uniform Continuity and the Definition of the Derivative
Love this

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
is this course enough to get started with ml ?

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
what a beautiful functions. that's why i love linear algebra.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
This kind of lecture is only possible when your deep passion for your work! Huge Thanks, Sir Strang!

### 12. Iterated Expectations
expectation mean and var are the most difficult to be understood.

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT professors. Thank you MIT so much. I really appreciate it.

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Spammers. I think they are trying to fool youtube's subscription/advertisement system.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am amazed at the number of people that freaked out at the Taylor expansion and seemed to hate them. I thought they were one of the most elegant and powerful things I has seen in mathematics and they answered so many questions.

Now trig substitutions, those are ugly.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I love this lecture so much. I turned from hating math to see a useful part of its application. Thank you OCW

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
amazing lecturer.


### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Most of our memory is used up in notaion only,chopping is required.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
thank you! MIT

### 19. Weak Law of Large Numbers
Thank you for the lecture, extremely useful!

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
PFD is probably my favorite method of integration, it's a pretty satisfying process and you end up with a very nice and simple answer.

### 13. Regression
He just gives you much more than he has to. I understand people who comment that it is hard to follow him sometimes, but come on, you can watch the video as many times as you need and you can use some books also (not to mention that we should use more those old fashioned friends). For me, the best statistician available in youtube giving a high level lecture which combines a practical but theoretical approach.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
This is a seriously gifted teacher

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How did you do on the test mate?

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Thanks dear Sir,  love you. You are like God for us

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's the most complicated way of finding cofactors I have ever seen.... Use the simple formula.....A(ij) = (-1)^i+j M(ij)

### 3. Independence
so if my probability of a event B ocurs doesn't change if A ocurrs, A and B are independent?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love the way this instructor presents this subject!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The point is, they doesn't have the greatests! All american intellectual grandiosity is feeded by foreigns!. Aside from a very limited proportion of notable american scientists, almost all contributions of americans to science, has been made by foreings residing in USA, mainly europeans. Today's american science survives thanks to the influx of scientists from the former USSR, China and India. They are just clever employers to chose who, and good salesmans of their universities.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
If this is what classes were back at the 2000's, I wonder how good they have become as of now 2010

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
My brain. I can feel it.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Thank you Mr Strang.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I like the column perspective.

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
Thanks MIT.  Views of (video 7.)/ Views of (video 1.) is about 10%.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is an excellent, step-by-step proof that I will never be a mathematician.

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
how is the line intergral limit of example 1: c3 curve from 0 to 1/root2 ??? why is that point (1/root2,1/root2)

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
What is good homework to test if we clearly understand this lecture? Is there such corresponding homework?

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Ah, the functional analysis. Together with topology, my favorite subjects in uni.

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
7:31 

I once read a comment on some OCW video in which a guy said that it was his dream to go to one of these classes, raise his hand and ask the professor if he should draw 4 with the top two line segments joined or not. The student @7:31 almost realized that dream.

😂

### 3. Independence
6

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Probably I am missing something. Keeping in mind the graph of the area going to infinity, If the limit approaches a finite positive number, let's say 3, wouldn't the area under the curve still be infinite?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Sir is exceptional . I have never ever seen a mathematician and a teacher with such impeccable command over his knowledge and his art of teaching. It seems he know how to present a hypothesis, how to negate it and eventually explain the validity of that hypothesis. He’s the best in the business

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Awesome Teacher Gibert Strang

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i love this guy so much

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
This guy wasted 44 minutes of an 80 minutes(?) lecture with bullshit and I gave up. I'll read a book instead.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I had to check how old he is - 84 and still going strong. Hell I know an 83 year old who swims  4km a day in the surf.   His a superb mathematical communicator - up there with the late, great Eli Stein at Princeton who is sadly missed.  May Gil continue to do his thing for many years to come.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Best way to teach determinants. I used to worry about how this is the worst part of linear algebra since it involved a big formula that was thrown to me. I loved the intuition about the property 9 about volumes of n dimensional cubes. Never thought determinants would get me this excited.
Long Live Prof. Strang.
Thankyou MIT.

### Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators
Good 😘🇮🇳

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
by far the best video of integrals I've ever seen. he made it so clear to me..thanks

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Lecture aside, I just wanna say that the course structure of 30% assignments, 2x 15% midterms and a 40% Final is very smart. 

Looks like grading is more focused on learning throughout the semester to engage the students. 

Courses with 50% Final and 2x 25% midterms or similar does not do anything to help students learn in the long term. Great class structure

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
he is indeed very good but actually he is greek

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
44:16 When you see your ex again

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone know this professor's name?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
What Software does Prof. Rigollet use to make these slides?
I guess it's RMarkdown but can someone confirm?

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Since the box is hollow, shouldn't the total surface area be 2 x (bottom) + 8(side) ? Since it will have inner and outer surfaces (the box being hollow)? So essentially 2 * x^2 + 8 * (V / x)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can anyone tell me which book should i prefer with these lectures.??

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
We won't get a teacher like him possibly in our life time. 100 years fast forward people would be amazed to listen to his lectures and would marvel at the quality of education 100 years ago.

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

As x tends to 0,
 sinx/x tends to 1.
At x=0.1,
 Sinx/x = sin(0.1)/0.1 
= 0.99833416646....
At x = 0.01,
Sin(0.01)/0.01
= 0.99998333341....
At x = 0.0001
Sin(0.0001)/0.0001
= 0.99999999833....
At x = 0.00000001
sin(0.00000001)/0.00000001
= 0.99999999999....

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Best teacher for machine learning. God bless him.

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
Professor Strang ,thank you so much for a straight forward lecture on computing eigenvalues and singular values in numerical linear algebra.

### 25. Interactive Proof Systems, IP
This was really helpful, thank you!

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
When U and V transposed are the same, do these matrices represent a change of basis matrix? Because for this to happen, A has to be positive symmetric, so then the singular values of A would equal the eigenvalues of A right? So if A represents a transformation , then the diagonal matrix sigma could be understood as that same transformation matrix but in the basis of eigenvalues, so then U = V transposed,  should be change of basis matrices ????
But when are change of basis matrices equal to each other????
Thank you!!

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
2 people didn't pass the course.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
nice

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I just finished watching 3Blue1Brown’s first video on matrix exponentials, it’s so well made.
Even though I feel like I haven’t fully understood  every aspect of this lecture, I do believe that with the help of 3Blue1Brown, this lecture might turn into intuition for me someday.

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
maybe using p for both the matrix P and the projection p is a bit unfortunate

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
worth spending time to see this wonderful video

### 27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives
I can't find how to derive the Loss func. in respect to weight1 or 2,3etc, SO how the math is done behind the derivative part of the gradient descent formula. Everyone is showing the result or a smaller reshaped formula, but I would need the steps inbetween. An example where we backprop a single perceptron (with 1 or 2 weights, L2 function) would do it.  Pls someone give me a link or a hand. Thanks!
 I do understand the essence of chain rule, but I wanna know dL/dw = dL/dPred * dPred/dw    (dL/dw is the change in the weight1 respec to L2 Loss function, dPred is the derivative of the neuron's output (mx+b) )
I don't get  why the result is 2(target-pred) * input1.
Is that because L2 is a squarefunction and the derivative of x^2 or error^2 is 2X , so 2error --> 2(target-pred), but then why the other parts of the formula disappear.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
youtube link for lec 14 is actually lec 4

### 4. Pushdown Automata, Conversion of CFG to PDA and Reverse Conversion
14:48 EE -> TT -> FF -> aa. You could interpret a* as exponentiation but I think that in general this leads to ambiguity if you're interpreting the CFG as a model for arithmetic.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
min 25:04 it would have been worth mentioning that the resulting integral is a mix of real + imaginary components

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
This is an amazing video! Here is my tutorial on Stochastic Gradient Descent with code explanation (in python). Hope it could be of help too. https://youtu.be/uXuBUkW_0tA

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I've only just learnt about eigenvalues and eigenvectors from KhanAcademy and Strang's Lecture 21 so a lot of this went whoooosh over my head, but managed to find the first 20 minutes useful. Hope to come back to this when I've looked at differential equations (which AFAIK are very daunting), etc and understand more of it.

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is patient ,and i am a little confuse of why he always put his hand in pocket?

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
For anyone wondering about the last claim, how $1 + (m + 1)c$ could be the (n = m+1) case, plug (m+1) into the inductive assumption, which results in $(1+c)^(m+1) \ge 1 + (m + 1)c$

Are there any awards given out in America for best Prof of the year, he knows how to teach a subject I knew something about know alot more thank you prof Strang

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
I dub this lecture as "Everything your parents didn't tell you about Linear Independence and you were afraid to ask" 
Thanks Professor Strang, you are a wonderful human being

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm a junior who is majoring in math and my calc professor in my university never taught me how he derived derivative of x^n. Imgaine the sheer difference of knowledge that students will aggregate when they graduate from MIT and other shit universities like mine :(. I envy students in MIT so much.

Could anyone tell me why we usually take the doubly infinitesimal number to be 0 but here it is valid to write ds^2 =/= 0?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I have always heard that everything is big in America - I kind of understand what they mean every time I see that fantastic board eraser.

strang gang!

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
MISTAKE @29:30? The set of vectors S is NOT a subspace bc (1)*(1,0,-1,0) + (-1)*(-1,0,1,0) = (2,0,0,0) which is not in S!

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Really appreciate for the courses, I studied math in college at 2005 in China and nearly forgot everything, maybe I never really understood them, but this course taught me so much, thanks for Dr Jerison and the substitution teacher, and each guy who contributed for these excellent work.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
for fast learner, none at all i guess but for folks like me? several. as an example i have an odd habit of going "huh?" if something new is taught. i cant do that over the internet, but somehow the live answers "sink in" a bit better. i guess im just thick.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
awful course!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Im in 9th grade and am in Algebra 1 so i think this just melted my brain, lol

oh my gosh. I laughed out loud at that too. I bet you did this when you were 5 years old.

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Brilliant man!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
A thousand years from now, people will still be learning matrix algebra from this guy.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Dear MIT rejects of the past,

We know you are still embittered over not getting admitted to our prestigious institution. We promise - it was never about your lack of academic ability or your IQ. Or your second place medal at that math competition.

This, here - MIT Open CourseWare -  is our long overdue apology to you. Behold, the MIT world-class education (that you should have gotten) - all from the convenience of your computer screen as you sip iced tea while in your PJ’s.

You’re welcome. And no hard feelings, we hope.

Love,
MIT

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
By convention sin⁻¹(x) means h/o whereas it really intends here is arcsin(x)? Has MIT adopted this confusing notation?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
The second part of the lecture going from Ux = 0 to Rx = 0 and further on to RN = 0, and proposing what is N, seemed to be full of leaps that I could not follow completely. I have done a ML course, and a Neural network course without a deeper knowledge of Linear Algebra. I thought of filling that gap. The rabbit hole seems to go deep, and again I seem to be taking a few magical things that happen to be as axiomatic. I will persist. If I can not get it from Prof Strang, I may not get it at all. Hope the pennies will drop as I move forward, and I will get rich!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
fuck, did anybody else find the last proof "sloppy"?? i'm guessing he made a mistake

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I have... is that right? sorry am I getting this correct. oh, I'm not. my God!!!

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i wish i had a math teacher like that in my college. i can't complain about other teachers but my math teacher is a nightmare.

How is delta(u/v) =(u+deltau)/(v+deltav) - u/v at x+deltax?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]my teachers are excellent!!! and i guess its a preference? MTU has black boards in some classes but smart boards are mostly what they have. i love them, and i learn excellent from them.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
it's really weird he said "you don't have" a formula for solving a 3rd degree polynomial http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/courses/cubic/ he's a mathematician so clearly he knows that such a formula has existed for 500 years and good bet a fair number of his students knew that as well, but he said "you don't even have such a formula".  at 42:35

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thanks a lot Dr. Strang, i'm really excited for the next lecture.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Don't  act confused guy, i'm not saying anything about the teaching capabilities if the lecturers or the work they cover at MIT. All i'm saying is that the title of being one of the greatest engineering schools in the world is due to talented students every now and then and a wide range of resources available to them.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Its Heaven for Mathematics Lovers....

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
ım just suprised how easy this is

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT. I scored 88% for both calculus and algebra in my August test

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This one was one of the hardest ones for me thus far

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
The professor artfully covers the fundamental idea of probability with deceptive ease. Many teachers easily confuse the students by writing the total probability theorem and Bayes' Theorem formulas first and try to fit in an example into the formula to explain the topic. One would lose intuition as to what is happening underneath those equation quickly and simply churn out the results by putting in values into the equation. But, the professor here only at the end mentions the name of Bayes and hardly uses the word Total probability theorem. He arrives at those generalisations with pure logic by intuitively applying multiplication rule, total probability theorem and Bayes’ rule to solve a problem at hand.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Cool absolutely loved it

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I`m learning English watching these incredible classes, thank you so much Teacher Strang and MIT

I so badly want to write on that blackboard only to erase using that amazing "eraser" (am I correct calling that an "eraser"? My english is prety poor).  I've never seen these things SO large. I'm going to get one of them for my own teaching.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
oh my! Everything's just crystal clear! Thanks Professor!

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
This is like pure intellectual chocolate. Gilbert Strang should've taken over Wonka's Chocolate Factory, not Charlie.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
I am midway in 18.06. It makes me so very happy and extremely saddens me at the same time. I am so happy that he's doing well and contributing so much, just shows how much he loves teaching and simplifying things. It saddens me to see the stark difference between him now and in 18.06. I wish he could just live forever.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

what GUI software professor Suvrit is using to change the step size instantly?

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
What interesting lecture is this. you showed how maths is a pillars of statistics. during the lecture I think of the assumptions of least square estimation. it comes from maths (like the independency assumption). great work.  God bless you prof.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Please name this beautiful lecture “A tour of the zoo of dicontinuities.”

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

19:54 "Let me suppose I got as far as u" lol

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i like it how he said zero was his favorite number. My calc teacher said zero is boring. They should get into a math teacher debate.

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
The way Mr Strang asks Why? Each Time a new case comes up just wins my heart with his innocence and curiosity .

### 34. Final Course Review

This is an amazing job. Thank you David Jerison , and everyone else who contributed this.

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
Thank you!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof Strang & MIT. Very clear lecturer

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Dedicated review lectures such as this one are so helpful. They are certainly useful for tying everything together and identifying remaining questions that students may have. However, at least in my experience this kind of lecture also has some psychological benefits, at least for some students, because they end up realizing they actually know most of the material. This is very important since what often holds students back is lack of confidence and overcomplicating things. And of course a review lecture by Prof. Strang himself is extra special!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
next level stuff :) .... null space = c*[-Free; Identity ] thanks

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Loved your way of teaching sir. It's seems like everything for registered in my memory.😃

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
basis is a bunch of vectors and not too many.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I've  really felt terrible, when there's  no students  in there... But prof. Strang   done it in a   simple  way 🥰🥰🥰

### 1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics
thank you mit!!

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank you #MitOpencrouseware. Live long professor strang. lots of love and respect from Pakistan.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
How lucky we are to have another wonderful Strang lecture! His insightful presentations are always a treat, and it's great to see his take on deep learning applications. 
Minor chalk-o: he rotated Ax the wrong way at 27:22 (but the math is still right)

### 13. Bernoulli Process
I followed through the whole series, and this is the BEST Statistics course I have ever taken. Thank you Prof Tsitsiklis for being so clear and concise. I had never imagined a starting statistics course enhancing my understanding so much and giving me so much confidence. This is magic!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this a real MIT Calc class recording? or a modified version for the public with easier material? I looked at the exams in the link and I was in SHOCK!!
I go to McGill and this is way too easy compared to my uni.. NOT FAIR!!!!!!!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Fantastic advice, he is our elder he is really smart at this task and all the while he is level in head to realize what he knows you are learning so patients.
I cannot do math, however he is really a pleasure to listen to and learn wisdom form regardless. I will still go watch his 18-06 course. humor is easy for all of us if we are the current one as the top in our skill set regardless the skill set we are sharing with others willing to learn that skill from each of us.
Lance & Patrick.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Why does he call it a "vector"  ??

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Can someone please help me with the drawing of the column space at the end of the video? Is he saying that if I summed up all the possible linear combinations of the two columns made from matrix A, I'd end up with a 2D plane in a 3D space?

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
at 38:00 , we take a non-linear transformation of Xn bar as the statistic. How can it still be Gaussian? He said in a previous lecture it is not Gaussian.

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
in my opinion it doesnt matter if you do that stuff in high school or not. if you like mathematics you find a good book and learn anything you like. i live in greece and when i finished high school i bought a book on calculus 2 and studied it alone. it was waaay better than school or uni.university is overpriced really

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
This lecture made so much sense. My current professor doesn't do a good job in keeping it interesting. Great lecture!

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this question is asked way too much, maybe it would be easier for mit to just relabel lectures (i mean an in class exam dosent really count as a lecture)

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
What will be matrix A if I want to express y''+y=0 in the form Ay=0 ?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
"at least that was the artist's intent when he drew it" lol love these lectures

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
Is every DFA an NFA? My initial guess was yes but not every DFA accepts the empty string. NFA must accept the empty string. 
Thanks in advance.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like how this free class even excludes the errors, making it ten times better than the paid for class above...those two mistakes with the x (should have been u) could greatly confuse one

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
my mind is blown! not by linear algebra... but by Gilbert Strang's teaching <3

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Could anyone please tell me: what does he mean by saying "to first order it will not change (27'50'')"? Thank you so much.

Can MIT OCW please make short video lecture series complemented with interesting problems, so that it is easier and more effective to learn?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Way ❤️

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
27:45. Shouldn't it be just A? i mean A=[a1  a2]. but now we have a1(trans) and a2(trans) in its columns, not just a1, a2. How could that be A(trans.) ??

### 14. Poisson Process I
Not even a chuckle at the "B movie" joke?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
I am confused about the second and third methods. How is c a linear combination of A's column. My first thought it is a linear combination of A's row.
I am talking about the second merhod.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
He looks like Moriarity from the new "Sherlock".... and he is a real professor too!!!

### Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values
12:56 How did he get the formula for σk(x). Can anyone explains?

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
45:50 Wait, isn't that only true for orthoNORMAL matrices? If matrix is just orthogonal, there will be squares of it's vector's lengths on the diagonal.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Professor Strang be drawing lines straighter than my life

### 13. Regression
Lecture is a replacement of your reading for obtaining information. Learning new information cannot be done by someone else regardless of your laziness. Lecture is actually to understand the thought process of the experts that is not obvious from words. Focus is NOT on the information itself, which should have been obtained through reading, but rather on his path of thought while exploring these concepts. Go to Khan if you're looking for someone to spoon you with new information.

### 34. Final Course Review
Today i completed this course, i'm not a science major I'm an Eco student and just started learning Maths so that i can pursue Masters later and this is the 1st course that i took and it truly inspired me to learn more maths and never leave Linear Algebra, This could not have been possible without  Prof. Stang and MIT OCW. Thank you so much words cannot express my gratitude.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
It's a bit sad to see such brilliant people age... Let's hope and work towards that someday they won't have to struggle with age constrictions anymore. Just imagine how much more humanity could have achieved?... On the other hand I'm trully happy to see dedicated people like him, still spreading knowledge and wisdom - no matter what!

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what kind of book does the class use?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
if f=x+1, x>=0 and f=-x+1, x<0, is this function continuous? How will tangent to this function look at x=0?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
about couples,  what if x is male and y is female. and male control the position. and x isnt changing and y is changing.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
40:38 Wait...where is everyone? How many are there?

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah, it should have been s= velocity, and ds/dt=acceleration.  The derivative of velocity is acceleration.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Thank you Professor Strang for showing us the beauty of math!

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
viva la france !!

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
I highly recommend doing the Frobenius norm proof he mentions. It is elegant and uses some nice properties of linear algebra. If you took 18.06 (or watched the lectures) using the column & row picture of matrix multiplication really helps. I'll finalize my proof and post a link - hopefully I didn't make a mistake ;)

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Positive Semi-Definite matricies: 38.01

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Thanks Professor Gilbert Strang

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I agree. The problem with folks back then is that something that was obviously simple was made difficult to justify their supposed intelligence. Calculus and basically nothing is hard if explained CORRECTLY. Descartes said this many centuries.

### 25. Stochastic Gradient Descent
Amazing for MIT to make such high quality lectures available worldwide. Well worth time investment to go thru these lectures. Thanks Prof Strang & Prof Suvrit & MIT

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Prof. Strang is a Magician, he shows that  Matrix is synonymous to Magic.

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
VIVA LA FRANCE! This man knows his stuff.

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
So if anyone is interested for an explanation of 38:00-38:31 roughly. x takes on values which are all the Natural numbers 1,2,3,4.... etc. Now if we want to find the probability values after some number of trials we'd obviously have to start after some variable, lets say 'n' amount of numbers. Expressing where we start by x, given the values that x takes would mean we'd have to write x+n whatever n is. In the video it is 1.

This implies that the expectation value given that x is all values greater than some n:
E[x|x>n]
notice how the specification of 'greater than n' is only nontrivial insofar as x takes on values from all the natural numbers. We specify this since we dont change the domain of values that x itself takes. Our problem would be solved if we just suggested that x take on values greater than n in itself, however we do not.

Now given this, we basically have to restrict the expectation values to when x>n, we'd have to start calculating expectation values at x+n. So suppose we start at the point n=5, ie. x is always greater than 5 (again, in the video it starts at n=1), then we'd do add 5 to natural number in x and thus we could attain the distribution we we're trying to attain by adjusting the random variables this way from the initial distribution.

In other words for any E[x+n] (note it is implicit here however this means E[x+n|initial sample space]).
This is a calculation of the expectation values of x greater than n.

We can express it in terms of the actual formula to make it more evident.
(x+n)p_X(x+n)=E[x+n] again, where x takes on the value of the natural numbers. Meaning that thus for every natural number from 1, we are adding n, making the formula apply on the values that are n greater than what would otherwise be in just E[x].

So as a consequence then E[x|x>n]=E[x+n|initial sample space]=E[x+n].

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
How a perfect thing that being able to be a great mathematician and a great teacher at the same time! Especially, being a great teacher is priceless!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Because they can get an orgasm out of linear algebra as if polynomials weren't enough.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One Month And Am done..... Ten days of serious revision and problem set rehandling... thanks mit and iit (India)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The level of the calculus might be low, but he is explaining the proof and intuition in very clear, insightful ways that you don't normally get from a high school teacher. Well worth watching. Thank you MIT!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Because of you I love math ❤️

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I was in MIT. I hate being poor.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wasn't just talking about this lecture....I was talking about their practice exams involving the gradients and tangent line equations you build about   1/2 way thru multvariable calculus. MIT is a great school, that teaches you what you need to know for your future. However, I think it is not where you go to college but rather what you do at the college you go to.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
I thought that i'm not smart to understand probability, but turned out that it depends on who is teaching it. this prof. is great.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace

Superb explanation sir 🙌🙌🙌

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
6:45 he does reply as far as he can! I sent him am email thanking him for the lectures before watching this interview, and I actually did not expect a reply. But he did sent an appreciation reply to my email and he was so nice as well!

What a wonderful professor!

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]was THE best question raised by that girl, which was missed by professor badly in his entire explanation.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Such a great professor

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
He certainly shows there is a big difference between knowing a subject and knowing how to teach it to others.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
if you are given the components of two vectors (e.g. u=(2,3,6) and v=(2,3,-6)) how do you use this to find the angle between them?

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
did he say "an orgy of problems" at 15:30?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i like this teacher but he has explained very badly the related rates problems. Is very difficoult to see the beuty of maths with this man but is ok for practical instances.
Thanks MIT

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
@[USERNAME]shouldn't it be det >=0 to account for the solutions with steady state? And I suppose yes, this lecture is clear if you have been previously exposed to at least basic differential equations. But hey! OCW offers that course for free too! ;)

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
From 21:24, he starts covering Inverse, the section before covers 5 ways of matrix multiplication

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
If theres four variable then how to draw a 4d pic like that of row and column....

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is a VERY well done lecture.  At around 25:46 when the camera pans away, I can see all the material that was covered, and not only do I remember all of it clearly, I'm surprised we've covered so much, because I don't feel overwhelmed.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]don't blame the professor.

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
19:40 if you turn the volume down everything he says changes its meaning

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The maths Professor I've been wanting my whole life, finaaaallly I understand these things. Thank you! =)

### 17. Markov Chains II
Excellent courses by professor Tsitsiklis .Ευχαριστώ πολύ κύριεΤσιτσικλή

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Well, this is a lecture to people who have no idea what a vector, Matrix or Eigenvalue is!
They have to learn first before using the PC to solve problems.
If not,  it is GIGO!

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I've never understood null space, rref, and how null basis is immediate from rref better.
I'd recommend Dr. Strang to anyone that tries to learn linear algebra.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
5:20 These are MIT kids?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
really ironic that the first question asked was about the algebra involved....arent these people supposed to be super duper smart?

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love this series. Thank you professor. Thank you MIT. 

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
For those like me, who did not get about the free columns and pivot columns fiasco at first.
Firstly, note that the free columns are linear combinations of the pivot columns (you can do some scribbling to confirm this).
This gives some intuition as to why we can allow the free columns to be scaled freely by    any number, then solving for the scalars of the pivot columns, such that you get zero column/vector if you add all these scaled columns. 
Pivot variables and free variables are the names for those respected scalars.
I hope this cleared some doubts...wish you the best of luck.

### Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space
I miss the days when professors / instructors took pride in their appearance.  Not expecting someone to wear a suit (though it's professional-looking), but a wrinkled up shirt?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 20:41, we can write {2-2cost}^1/2=|2sin(t/2)| ,the integral thus equals 8.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
There is a reason that the ground goes down.  If anyone else saw the electric outlets on the wall, the thumb doesn't contact any of the bare connectors but the finger below the thumb does and many people get electrocuted unless the ground is down.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
he is using the term log as natural log and i am writing the wrong things down.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
https://youtu.be/e3ZdAJTSIas

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Most of us trying to learn math are often not made aware of the fact that Math is a tool for understanding how the world works and it's not just the computations that make up the god damn thing. I am amazed by this way of teaching, in which the professor asks the question why and gives it much more importance than all the nitty gritties of how. At 33:44, the professor even points it out. I don't know why all the professors can't seem to see the learning process in the same way. Hats off to this amazing teacher!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing,...
Strang has reinvented himself and his knowledge and teaching style of Linear Algebra with the advent of Deep Learning projects and applications.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]
I meant (>)
This was just an example.I wanted to ask if it was possible to differentiate
things like f(x)>g(x) and have still the  >
But after some thinking i understanded that this canNOT happen no way because the fact that f(x) > g(x) for every real x means that the graph of f(x) is higher from g(x) for every real x.But f derivative represents the slope of the tangent of f at x, giving us the monotony of f.Hope you understanded what i mean.Also thanks for the reply

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you very much. I have a hard time with this course. This video helps me a lot.

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
40:03 why the fixed count part is 32? I thought 64 since we have 2 D in the left matrix.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This is my MATLAB code for his example at 23:35 min, 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
clear all
clc
outcome = 2; % outcome # of a coin (Head & Tail)
n = 4; % tossing #
k = 0:n; % # of getting Head or Tail ( zero means no Head or no Tail)
p = 1/outcome; % the probability of a single outcome

Px = zeros(1, size(k,2)); % store the results in a vector

for i = 1:size(k,2)
        Px(i) = nchoosek(n,k(i))* p^k(i) * (1-p)^(n-k(i));
end

plot(k, Px)
xlim([  min(k),    max(k)])
ylim([min(Px), max(Px)])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only thing you need to change is n. Play around with it.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Somehow, I managed to forget all that. Now, I have watched this lecture 3 times with an interval of one week. After that I should never forget how to find inverse :)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Having a great teacher is so important! I have known all these operations for over 20 years, but really until now I know what it truly means by matrix multiplication! All my previous teacher just shown me the operations but never explained what it is trying to do.

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:38 I thought the derivative is not a number? *_* I'm confused

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Maybe it's because i already understand lagrange multipliers, but they should not be that lost. this explanation is pretty decent, imho

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In Russia we learn this in 10th grade. In America they also learn this in 10/11 grade however this is just an review + some new stuff. This course lasts for only 1 semester. In school it takes you a year, while this is ONE SEMESTER. 

US still has and will have the best engineers in the world because they think creatively, and not just learn everything in the world. They apply their skills instead of inventing new. And no offense to anyone not in US, every country has amazing universities. 

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Once we know one value of c from the mean value theorem, we can differentiate the function and let it be equal to (f(c))' that we found from the mean value theorem, and therefore we can find the other values of c where the slope of the tangent line to the function equals (f(c))'!

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

yea he almost looks like the number 1

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
الله يبارك في عمره ويعطيه الصحة والعافية. ما شاء الله عليه.  
Pure Pleasure .

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Thank u very much Prof. Strang !

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
mu

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
Excellent series, but why is the tenth lecture missing?

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
So this is my idea of a "vector subspace": It's an (N-1) dimensional slice of an N dimensional space, although it's only (N-1) dimensional in a certain sense of dimensionality size, because it has a sort of location information in N dimensions. So a vector space in R3 can be thought of a plane, a 2 dimensional object, relative to a 3 dimensional space. And the plane in this example must contain the origin of R3. 

It's hard to describe in terms of "dimensionality". Yay or nay

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Starbuck's has poor internet


### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i love this sooo much

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
This teacher, oh boy I can`t remember his name... Well... I really appreciate how he uses intuition to teach Linear Algebra. I'd like to have had classes with him at the school. I would have saved many hours of my life studying for silly tests.

Sometimes I feel like studying Engineering made me less smart than I was as child. Sometimes I can really know that my teachers are trying to kill my creativity and coercing me to learn the hardway, nor the better way nor the easy way: just the way they had learned or the only way the can teach.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
41:42 : "it turns out to be 5/18, we won't do it"..... yeah I think they should have done it XD. I also think it's (5/24)/(4/3), which makes (5/32) as the final answer.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 41:40 it should be 5/32

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thank you very very much!

### 5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)
The way he revealed the likelihood function in its usual form from that series of steps is super mindblowing. I wish my professor showed me how it comes from the TV to the KL then to that.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Happy Halloween! I see a student cosplayed as Grim Reaper.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Last segment is interesting: |A_n| = |A_n-1| - |A_n-2| looked awfully fibonacci-like.  It turns out that the determinants of the symmetric tridiagonal matrices with i in the non-diagonal entries exactly follows the Fibonacci sequence.

Mind blown yet again.

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great professor.  that is why mit is mit. --comment from a freshman from cuhksz

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
He is abolute legend !

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
It's pleasure to be a student at a time when great teachers like Gilbert Strang are there for you. 
Professor Strang is one of the teachers because of whom I decided to follow my career in mathematical research rather than going for engineering.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
fun fact: number of ppl watching the next coming lectures are linearly decreasing oops.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
God, I love this man!

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I think he made a mistake when he said "the other rows are a combination of the first two" at 32:52...

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Woot, Strang just dropped a hot track.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
am surprised to see chalk being used in such a "top-notch" school. they don't even use chalk in our primary schools........lol........but good job anyway!

### Lecture 23: The Dirichlet Problem on an Interval
Trump 2024.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wow these lectures are crystal clear how do others manage to blur it out so badly ;-;

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Who is watching from india

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I just want to get my hands on some of that chalk...

### 3. Independence
These lectures are great

### 15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt
why is y^Tx equal to 1?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
one way to prove property 4 is to use property 2: ( a b; c d) = ( tc td; c d) then the determinant is t* (cd-cd) which is 0. I love the way prof. Strang teaches it's inspiring

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
I did a maths degree, I've know about Kirchoff's Rule, and I studied linear algebra.  No one explained how it was all connected like this.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
棒

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
at 51:00 did he mean e^(8*pi/3) which would be 1 instead of e^(6*pi/3)?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
7:19 to 8:09 were the most hopeless and confusing seconds of my life.

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
who needs proofs!?

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought that single variable calculus was a highschool subject i the US. Why are they giving that in MIT?

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Is is necessary to be fluent in matrix and determinants before taking this course ?
Note-I asked this because the prerequisites are not clear on MIT OCW web page.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Pretty awesome.. (y)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is the problem set somewhere accessible to general public members?

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
there is nothing wrong with him...he only has a french accent...but goes figures!!! MY mult calc prof sure has a heavy accent!!!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Speed cannot be negative

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
So the independent columns are associated with dependent variables whereas dependent columns give us free variables that can be  arbitrarily assigned in the equation.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am gonna watch the whole series. What a great teacher man! 👌 Keep it up.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
the man's intelligence x his ability to teach is off the charts! it's sexy and, even better, it makes me want to learn more

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The one person that disliked this didn't get into MIT.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I guess you simply don't understand it or you don't know/forgot that all of this matrix stuff is an abstraction (or not even that, just a different notation) of solving systems of linear equations. Oh besides, linear algebra is often used to simplify functions in calculus. 

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
lovely blackboard :)

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder that half of students who are taking this class don't even know about Law Cosine.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Olm biliom la bunları ayt mat 40da 40 yapmıştım yani bunlar ezzzz mayonezzzz

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
a toin coss

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The first 34 minutes of this lecture are devoted to a probability problem from lecture 23 that he didn't have time to get to because he answered so many questions during that lecture.  There was NO accompanying reading so far as I know, so this is all there was on this topic.   Probability is supposed to be seen as another example of weighted averages, which WAS in the reading for lecture 23.

### 17. Space Complexity, PSPACE, Savitch's Theorem
1:04:25 we also cant store the t because t is both exponential and indirectly affected by length of n which means space becomes non-polinomial

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Love it.

### Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Ok, but mathematically, how can you define that? In Differential geometry, an expression like dx maybe means a 1-form. But the "vector" (dx,dy,dz) has no sense.

### 18. Properties of Determinants
The definition is just brilliant

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Best video I have watched so far, I was with him all the way and my concentration never dipped.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
at 5:42, wasn't it supposed to be b*d*i rather than b*f*g?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT and professor Auroux !

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
Thanks a lot sir :-)

### 34. Final Course Review
really humous,nice guy.wish i can watch this video earlier

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This teacher sucks. How on earth did he get a job at MIT?

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I Really Like The Video From Your Stokes' theorem (cont.); review.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
A Beautiful Man

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
At 21:20, he says "I set this delta x to zero." So just like that? You can just set it to zero randomly? I'm so confused as to why/how it is zero, then magically disappears.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
after you learn the math, learn how to teach it.

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
10:56 "With new notations comes new responsibility." ~Auroux

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best lecture from India

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why didn’t he explain method of washers? They mention it in the recitation vid.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
perhaps he applied it to find a living. how about you where you think he put what he learned from MIT....want to say something again. how about you, where you at?

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
haha 'If you are European and dont know what sec is...' that made me laugh

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
رائع

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Deepest thanks Prof. Strang!!!!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
From the thumbnail of this video, I almost thought it was Filthy Frank teaching this course lol. Anyways, awesome video, thanks for the lesson.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Because MIT is just that awesome. Too bad I never heard of the process for applying to US universities. Only 19 people made it to US universities from my country this year. That shows how our country lacks in terms of progress. 

### Lecture 23: The Dirichlet Problem on an Interval
Cool

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
13:19

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
His classes get u hooked up like its some sitcom that u wanna binge watch.

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
So cute mistakes. Love you sir from India 😊😊😊

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
U0 == "you know it"

First time I've heard his boston accent c:

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]nadeem ur absolutely right. David jerison assumes many things to be understoos. And he completely is incapable of understanding his students and what should be hard and confusing at their level. For god'sake he couldn't even understand that a student who asked a question had the very basic problem of how negative number is larger or smaller than other negative numbers ie -3 is larger than -4. He is simply a incompetent teacher. I wish they let christine breiner lecture instead of him

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am  stuck at this point where he finds out the minima and maxima of ax^2+bxy+cx^2 through sum of squares. As per my understanding, to find out the critical point, we need to find if the slope at that point is 0. But, through the quadratic equation, we did not actually find the slope. How was the the critical point determined in that case?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Thank you MIT. It is helping me to understand the fundamentals of linear algebra.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Ooooh, I'm excited! This is exactly the sort of course I've been looking for :D

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What happene'd at 18：00？

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Instruction begins at 13:22

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
I find the way he explains the material absolutely amazing!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
"projectors are trying to be identity, but it's impossible."

### 16. Markov Chains I
Sir, Ty for your video.  Easy to understand your teaching, I don't need to go school anymore.

### 26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning
Does anyone know to which exact paper by Dr. Jon Kleinberg does Prof Strang  refer to towards the end?

### 8. Continuous Random Variables
He definitely says it backwards at 49:18. I love this guy though

guy in white at 14:39 votes for the both possible answers. He is probably reasoning with quantum physics using the Schrodinger equation, where you can and cannot simultaneously extend a stack of blocks any arbitrary length.

### 6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments

### Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series
Thank you for this priceless journey to wonderlands of beautiful mathematical structures!

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is amazing. Why am I paying for my current education. I get so much more  from these vids.

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Around 1:02:00 , the instructor mentions that C is complete , meaning that for all x belongs to X,  u(x) = lim u_n(x). What i got confused is that he mentioned that it has a point wise limit(space of continuous bounded functions), however, this would mean given an x, and epsilon, we can find an N, such that u_n(x) converges to u(x). But by completeness of C, it says for every x , un(x) has a limit( isnt this uniform convergence in C)? and if so, doesnt that show uniform convergence in set of bounded continuous functions? Im confused

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Protect him with all cost MIT

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
This lecture is a true masterpiece. I was in awe with the similar feeling of watching suspense thrillers.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you, Prof. Strang. You made the world a better place

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
One question I have here is with the rotation and stretching - if A is a rectangular matrix does it not project  x into a lower or higher dimensional space?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Any faces with combination Eigenfaces!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Which book do they refer in MIT? Anyone please tell.(for linear algebra)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
can anyone explain to me the sense of the points he makes at the end of every word he writes on the board?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Double Toin Coss. 25:08

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
It will be great if the answer to the psets can be posted same as exams as for studying the way to write proofs!

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
好正！！！

### 18. Properties of Determinants
At 45:30 he describes the "L" matrix as "Lower triangular matrix with 1s on the diagonal". In this case "L" is not exactly lower triangular but a special form of lower triangular matrix. Isn't it? Because I think the diagonal of lower triangular matrix doesn't have to consist of 1s ...

### 18. Properties of Determinants
LOL

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
How many black boards does this guy have?!

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
can someone explain to me, why we cant think of two coin flips as two connected experiments instead of just one ?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
thanks!

### Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
What sort of camera do they use........YOu get sucha gud picture when zoomed in

### Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
46:00 about the Taylor expansion. Why is it always that students think that you don't need previous course information to go through the next course? I remember in highschool on physics when we've had the mechanics and started thermodynamics. Then on the mid term there was a question that how high a sentimeter cube of ice at temperature -1 degree of celsius should be dropped so that it would melt on impact. Of course all was taken in vacuum. More than half failed that question and complained that why is the motion formulas needed in calculating thermodynamics. What morons.

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
I wish he had covered hypothesis testing of parameter estimates !

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Who else watches these at 2x??

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
love the accent, great video


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Awesome quality

### Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
We used m,n, and p.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Lectures with my prof feel like fistfighting a grizzly bear, lessons with gilbert feel like being sung a lullaby by celine dion

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]further, don't  give such nonsense reply  to such interesting video.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
@[USERNAME]no it cant be as the pivots are the elements in the diagonal of the matrix.

### Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why, because they'are not finished with writiing it down on their papers ...

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm smart.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Very nicely acting as if students are watching.

### Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
damn, I thought the first draft was an Italian bread, lol... Honestly I have to go over this stuff in maybe two years from now and I was trying to get "in-touch" whit this stuff....REALLY CRAZY

### 12. Iterated Expectations
at 33:00, in Y=1 universe, f(x)dx=P(x) where dx=1, P(x)=1, therefore f(x)=1, now var(X|Y=1)=integral of ((x-E[X|Y=1])^2*f(x)) from 0 to 1. . that's how he got 1/12. and similarly for Y=2 universe..Is this correct?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
أول عربية استاد رائع و بناء جميل لدرس

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am intoxated by just the name of MIT! I am intensely in love with MIT! I am not just rich enough to be known as part of MIT! And also smartness..wel..I just dont work as hard....

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I am wondering why Strangs vectors 1 2 3 4 and 1 1 1 1 and 2 3 4 5 are a good example because the 3rd vector 2 3 4 5 is the sum of 1 2 3 4 and 1 1 1 1. I think this is a shit example. and nobody pointed this out in class. which is no surprise. Everybody in class is in a coma already.

### Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
34:00 ,I just wanted to mark this point for future reference

I cannot thank you enough for this clear, insightful lecture. It is very inspiring that you are calling the matrices "beautiful", and I can feel your love for them :) For me your lectures are beautiful.

### 18. Bayesian Statistics (cont.)
This is what I was looking for. Mamy thanks MIT.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
those MIT blackboards are like Hogwarts...secret boards out of nowhere

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Mind is now blown

### 7. Discrete Random Variables III
why is E[X^2] equal to the sum of all the X^2 plus the sum of all X_i and X_j (at minute 45)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
very articulate :)

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What's the connection between differentials/total differentiation and the implicit function theorem or implicit differentiation?

### 18. Markov Chains III
This is incredible. First time seeing Markov Chains, and I can't believe I never took the time to check it out. Plugging in the Poisson blew my mind.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
each side has a different audio, one from microfone and another from the hall(something like that).
BAD idea

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
This video is a masterpiece!!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Love this guy! Thank you so much!


### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Monkeyrunky, you're misunderstanding the point of MIT.

Some of the material taught in MIT is really the same as in other universities. In fact, vectors are taught in many high schools already. 

MIT definitely exceptional. I haven't been there myself, but you can see for yourself if you do ever attend it.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
One person disliked this video because he realized once 3d flux was explained excellently he still didn't understand it

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
I really don't know what to say..... Satisfying? Grateful? OMG I just love it!!!!

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
i am like schmdit in my group projects.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Prof Strang...my respects sir...

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
isnt this like constructing an iteritve formula for approximating the root?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Thank you, Professor! Elimination matrix inverses are one thing that I admire about this video. They are so intuitive to construct now.

### Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
Increasing the speed to 1.5 to 2x makes this really interesting :)

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Using the radar example instead of talking in "math speak" helps so much!!

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
I see that this professor does not take question in class. .  Maybe if you email him.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
immortal in 2020!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Interesting that nobody on the first row of seats looked like taking notes.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
The graphic quality is really sucks but the lecture is good

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
it took 5 months to my teacher to explain this 30 minutes video

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Just finished. Absolutely loved the series. Is there any series for Abstract Algebra too?

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
This is like a post-apocalyptic scene, where all other humans are gone and Gilbert is the only person left alive. He still does his lectures for an empty class because he has gone insane X)

I just want to be clear: I love Strang and this video series. It helped me pass a course on visalization <3

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Ok two things. First - That is one giant piece of chalk. Second - To be able to lecture this well with nobody sitting in front speaks volumes about the qualities of this great teacher.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
patrick JmT teaches better than this dr.

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME], well I have a different theory about it, I don't think everybody have the same knowledge or intelligence, I am all for happiness, it will make me happy to have a big farm and all kind of animals with me roaming free in the plains, also to have  beautiful women with my babies, but none of these is true, instead I study math and buid from nothing an abstract theory which sometimes is false, then computers come along with electronics, which is the only rational true machine we have.

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
This lecture is gonna be a little ambiguous at first BUT once you have a firm grip on the previous lectures from 18.06, you’ll surprisingly realise it is the most beautiful lecture on SVD available in all of YouTube.

### 2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem
haha, some magic happens

### Lecture 25: Power Series and the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem
Wonderful course

### 24. Markov Matrices; Fourier Series
I am completely lost in the last two lectures

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Oh, so you kids find calculus to be too easy ?  

Should any of you be able to find the general theorem for integrating a system of n variables/n dimensions by yourselves then yes, MIT is too easy for your level.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ok. You can touch the tangient point you find the fourt dimension.....:)
It`s a short way to the another galaxy.:)




### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Was the sentence at 9:21 supposed to be “Columns of C are combinations of columns of B”  instead of “Columns of C are combinations of columns of A” since he said that First column of C is equal to A*(B col1). And was the sentence at 11:12 supposed to be “Rows of C are combinations of rows of A” instead of “Rows of C are combinations of rows of B” ???

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nice .....

Very nice explaination sir....
Brilliant

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
At first this guy's style seems awkward and clumsy but then 30 minutes later you realise he's sucked you in completely and totally mesmerised you. Amazing teaching.

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Whew! Just finished the whole single variable Calculus course (Calculus I/II)!  That is time to take Calculus III (multi-variable Calculus).....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I didn't really understand what he said around 37:42. Can someone please clarify a little bit? Thank you!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I really miss the 18.01 lecturer David Jerison. I don't think this guy explains concepts very well.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I like this passion by teaching math 😍
Thank you for this nice example of teaching math in the best way 🤓

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
38:10
Go Sex

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If anyone is interested in a better lecturer than david. Then check out herbert gross lectures. He is a truly genious educator of math. His videos are the black and white ones but do not be discouraged by the age of the videos. The quality is superb,the cameraman focuses on the board and mr gross will make you fall in love with calculus

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i think i've fallen in love

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
The problem u not agreeing with the equation is that, after sigma and V have been determined, we no longer have freedom in constructing u. The u obtained with AA^T is still valid, but require different arrangement of sigma and V to accommodate. u has to equal [1 0; 0 -1] to agree with the sigma and V pair.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
love this course

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
the 7 dislikes are wierd.. cus if you like math i dont understand why you wouldnt like the video... and if you dont like math... why the hell would you view it?

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Linear approximation is﻿ the first order fit - i.e. tangent plane approximation. See previous lecture.
Let z ~ z0 + fsubxat(x0) *(x-x0) + fsubyat(y0) * (y-y0). Pardon terrible notation.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He's wearing the same shirt and pants as in Lecture 1

### Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b
I think professor Strang made a slight mistake @ 23:23 , it should be check q_1^T A_2 = 0 not q_1^T a_2 = 0

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Genius 👏👏👏

### 9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
really like this class

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I can never draw a 4-dimensional space on a 2-dimensional blackboard. It would look wrong no matter how I do it. (There is a vector perpendicular to an entire 3-D universe?)

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Than you Professor Strang for your compromise with education !!!!!!

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
Thank you!

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
God bless this teacher and MIT...I'm gonna be King -- I'm learning this....hehehe...I'm gonna rule the universe...and go to Mars...hehehe

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
go professor strang!!!

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
do me a favor...evaluate:
double integral of e^(y^2)dydx with the limits on the inner integral being: lower =
3x, upper = 3; limits on the outer integral being: lower = 0, upper =1.

### Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah theres an equivalent notation in the function notation two but it contains parentheses f^(2) (x)  (the 2's little), yeah nothing much, just thought it was funny, but it does happen- smart people can derp moment sometimes XD. 

### Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What's this guy's name? 


### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Completely lost with this lecture.   

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Exactly, thats the geometric way of seeing it.
In fact for very small numbers you can aproximate with low error sin(x)=x
Thats part of the Taylor Polinom

### 19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle
Saddle Points in 4D example at 6:30 and 16:30😃. This reminds me of the cover of the book "Linear Algebra and Learning from Data", the man with hat actually steps on the saddle "ring" of the net cage, which is also the most "comfortable" point to step on. Thanks a lot, Professor Strang!!

### 21. Bayesian Statistical Inference I
Excellent. It is so to the point and brilliant. It is like a diamond!

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
33:50 for Numerical integration

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Best explanation of the subject I have seen. The camera man is really good too and the chalk and the boards are easy to read..

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow, this professor gave a full review!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
My lecturer in Linear Algebra was pretty good at doing mathematics but he was not so good at explaining it. I have really enjoyed these lectures and came back to the start just to encourage others to watch and enjoy.

### 16. Markov Chains I
what's the sample space, experiments of Markov Chains? 
If Markov Chains has two steps, is the experiment of the first step the same as the experiment of the second step?

### 3. Parametric Inference
1:00:00 shouldn't it be 1-P(Z<(-mean/sigma))

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
that is just bullshit  this lecture suck eventhough its mit lecture cuz u can simply feel   We see vectors but  why did old people that lived in past feel vector necessary to find  the thing they called as vector subject  what does applications exist to use vector for real life  ur specifying a thing equals  to onether thing but ur not saying Why it is like that or  proof of that so  i didnt like

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
the professor is not only brilliant but humorous!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why do they teach derivatives before limits in MIT? Aren't limits the basis for both differential and integral calculus?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
15:36 where does he pull these numbers out from ?

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Completed the course just now , it was amazing 
Orz to the prof

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
A lot equivalent propositions here, prof strang beautifully demonstrated that they are all connected with the basic eliminations process, it helps a lot.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
"The thing is I like students, I like math, and putting them together is just the best job in the world." (G.Strang)

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
type "html5" after youtube in the address bard and then click the button next to the html5 trial (it'll be by the bottom of the screen). It makes most of the videos have the option of playing at 1.5 or 2 times the speed. :D 


### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
The prerequisite for this course is 18.06 Linear Algebra. For more information and course materials, see MIT OpenCourseWare at: https://ocw.mit.edu/18-065S18.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He made dA/dx = 0 because that´s the way to find the critical points.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Thank you Dr Strang for the amazing videos. I love the way you explain things so simply. Most of my teachers at University fail to explain simply things. They go into big terms while the basics is tough. With your videos I barely attend my classes but I am able to nail my exams. Thank you again!!

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you very much, from the bottom of my heart, Professor Strang! It took me around 40 days to finish this course. I learned an incredible amount, and I feel just as happy to have finished it as I am sad that it's over. It feels like finishing a very good, long and satisfying book. I'm studying meteorology, so I don't need the follow up courses for engineers, but you inspired me so much that I will watch them in my free time to solidify my understanding of linear algebra.

### Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!
Professor Strang - thank you for the amazing lectures and all the insights that you share with us!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What the hell kind of multivariable calculus course is this? thats 3 full lectures on vectors and 1 so far on matrices...

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
I actually passed my 3 Applied Linear Algebra courses with flying colors by just remembering all these results because the lecturer never tried to explaine what's happening behind the scene. So after almost 20 years I'm still here trying to figure out what's what. I shoulda gone to MIT.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Words can't describe how important it is for a mathematics lecturer to have passion in providing clarity with his explanations.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
when r< m, n, i.e. the last case in the summary board, can it have exactly one solution?

By column picture, professor plot each of 3 columns and also b for 1st example case, but did not tell about solution point (x,y,z)=(0,0,1). But he pointed out in row picture that all three planes intersect a point and it is (0,0,1) but difficult to locate by this row picture way! That’s why reverend professor present it in column picture way. Did I missed something? Please anyone help me out. Thanks

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
"three person game" !

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The courses I took in my local university were just theorem then proof proof proof. Zero explanation of why we even wanted to do this, nor ANY attempt to associate linear algebra to anything in the real world.  All students sat quietly and I wondered anyone would be able to point out anything wrong on the whiteboard.

One reason an university becoming world class is because of their enthusiastic and motivated teachers and students!

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It is quite possible you learned it in highschool... but more than likely a simplified version. Calculus theories like limits, derivatives, integrals...etc can be taught at a lower level math if you skip the details of the how and why. In college you need to learn those things that they left out so that you can move on in math. Try taking a college level math class in differential equations with only a base level understanding of calculus.

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
43:46 To prove intersection of 2 convex sets is still convex, I think x1, x2 are both in K1, then since K1 convex, any line from x1 to x2 are also convex. We don't need to consider whether K2 is convex or not. Am I correct?

25:17 Is it necessary for those vectors to be orthogonal to satisfy the projection?
Let's say c is 0. That means that vectors x1 and x2 are in the nullspace of P because they both have eigenvalue 0. Within this subspace, I can pick any two vectors as my eigenvectors, even if they're not orthogonal, can't I?

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
1~2:38. Important: the self-driving vehicle must know, hit pedestrians, don't hit telephone poles.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
45:12  Paraphrasing (and trying to cast it in the best light), here's what I heard:

Given a function whose derivative f'(x) exists at x0, prove that the function is continuous at x0.

1. By definition,  a function f(x) is continuous at the point x0 iff the lim as x->x0 of f(x) is equal to f(x0).
2. Stated equivalently, a function f(x) is continuous at the point x0 iff the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] -  f(x0)  is equal to zero.
3. So Let Z = [the lim as x->x0 of f(x)] - f(x0)  (and we'll see if we can get it to come out zero somehow).
4. Z = [the lim as x->x0 of f(x)]  -  [the lim as x->x0 of f(x0)].
5. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)].
6. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)] *  { [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] / [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] }.
7. Z = the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] / [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] } *  [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].
8. Z = the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] / (x-x0) } * [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].
9. Z = f'(x0) * [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].  (a critical step.  it removes the divide-by-zero conundrum.)
10. Z = f'(x0) * 0.
11. Z = 0.

Therefore, Given the existence of f'(x0),  which makes step 9 possible, the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] -  f(x0)  is equal to zero, and consequently the given function is continuous.

This is proof by demonstrating that the hypothesis plays an indispensable role in the conclusion.  Not my favorite method (by far!), but in the absence of a review of the algebra of absolute values and in the absence of an introduction of the epsilon-delta definition of a limit, I can't see how else the professor could have done it.

This course will be challenging to me in ways the authors never intended.  :)

I wish he could have explained better how it is that the angle QPR is theta. He was just like "you flip it over 90 degrees and there you go." There was barely any explanation of how it is that those triangles are similar! I had to pause the video, draw my own picture, and stare at it for half an hour to figure it out.

32:36 anyone notice that he did not say that ? :D

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
is there any way to change the bounds of integrations without drawing? because most of the times it wont be so easy to draw. (or i wont have the time to do it)

cant i just plug in the bound values into the change of variable's equations or do some other calculus?

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Does anyone else really like the yellow chalk at 13:37 ?

### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 12:08 in transcript it says "OK. A word of warming," It should be "warning." haha

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Waiting eagerly for 18.100B !!

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
1:42 "The idea of elimination ... I mean you would have thought of it .. Gauss thought of it before we did only because he was born earlier which is natural idea .. ahh .. died earlier too" ... ROFL! This prof has a geeky sense of humor ...

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Dayum, stuff makes sense

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Someone know why the x1 in he nullspace is (1 0) and not (0 1) as he said 26:36.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
they learn the general derivate formula at the mit, whats next :(

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
is there a book we are supposed to refer to?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
For the curious:

F_100 = (a^99 - b^99) * b/sqrt(5) + a^99 , where a = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 and b = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 are the two eigenvalues of our system of difference equations.

Numerically, F_100 = ~3.542248482 * 10^20 ... it's a very large number that grows like ~1.618^k 😲

Overall, great lecture Professor Strang! Thank you for posting, MIT OCW ☺️

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Thank you professor! I am amazed by the fact that professors from top institutes like MIT explain the mere basics without any expectation that we are supposed to know those topics earlier. On the other side our university professors just avoid the whole thing by saying "it isn't the part of syllabus, you are expected know this already". A huge salut and thanks to professor Strang and MIT team for publishing these videos free of cost.

Xparticular is calculated by setting all the free variables to zero. But in case, when rank=n, there wont be any free variables. How to find the Xparticular in this case?

### 20. Definitions and Inequalities
I’m really glad i didn’t give up and came this far, thank your Prof. Strang

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
WOW this was intense. Really really high density of concepts, yet everything is presented so clearly. This is a beautiful lecture.

### 32. Quiz 3 Review
36:32 He says that the decomposition is incorrect since the numbers in the diagonal matrix should be positive. Why can't the eigenvalues of A^T*A be negative? Didn't he just say how to find the signs of the number in the diagonal matrix using the expression: Av=sigma*u. Am I missing something here?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
ok, it's starting to go over my head, guys....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
In my highschool book, it proved the factoring of x to the n - y to then n with polynomials and horner. You devide that by x-y such that the remainder is 0 and if you do the horner, the factored identity comes out.

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
@[USERNAME]it's not an accident, because R is specifically designed so that when multiplied with C, A is produced.

The fact that this proves that the dimension of the row rank and column rank are the same (because the dimensions of C and R must agree) is kind of messing with my brain right now...

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
Easy stuff times horrible stuff

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I hate constrained partial derivatives. I'd just got to grips with Lagrange multipliers, and then he goes and introduces this. Evil :(

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Skipped lectures, so watching these before test

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Does the last equation (At*y=f) add any new information? I suppose find y (currents) from C*e would be last step right?

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love how smart and passionate yet chill the professor is. His personality perfectly fits that of a world-class serial killer.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
Great picture quality; thanks for updating this lecture.

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is exactly what I'm doing in class!

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
In the least-squares vs. PCA discussion that starts at 37:44, he's comparing minimizing sum of squares of vertical distances to minimizing sum of squares of squares of perpendicular distances.  However, each vertical error is related to each perpendicular error by the same multiplicative constant (cosine of the angle made by the estimated line), so in a way, minimizing one is tantamount to minimizing the other. Where the two methods do seem to differ is that least squares allows for an intercept term, while the PCA line goes through the origin.  However, when we look at the estimate of the intercept term (  b_0 = mean(y) - b_hat*mean(x)  ), least squares appears to be performing a de-meaning similar to the first step in PCA.  In summary, I think we would need a more thorough discussion than we see in the video in order to conclude that least squares and the first principal component of PCA are different.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
There's no one in the audience.

### 24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games
53:33 
He speaks facts here

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT

### 34. Final Course Review
I finally completed this amazing course today on 08/06/2022, it took 34 days to complete and it was totally worth it.
I watched all lectures, read all lecture summaries, recitation videos solved each problem set and exams.
Thanks to Professor Strang, the lectures were not difficult to understand, the hard part was doing them neatly and regularly.
Thank you Professor Strang for this amazing course !!!

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow♡♡
Thank you

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watching this to review calculus and my only issue with this instructor so far is this lecture. I love probability. it is usually fun and relatively straight forward... his approach to this problem was precisely the opposite of fun and straight forward.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Nice to see his speech.

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
can anyone explain why A*C^t=det A*I
i though it equals to (det A )^n * I
because we will factor det A from each row by property 3a

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I hope I don't get ridiculed for this because I'm just trying to learn. Ok so can someone please explain how:

0-1/Xo = -X/Xo^2 + 1/Xo

 becomes:

x/Xo^2c = 2/Xo

I've done a fair bit of algebra but just don't get it. Any help greatly appreciated!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this the next course after single variable calculus 18.01. I ask because they did some other topics b4 vector calculus in my school, Stuff like Taylor expansions and advanced integration techniques using trig identities.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you Prof. Strang. Nice and clear lectures.

### 22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum
34:36 gradient descent

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
James Harden walking in at 9:07

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
没有学生在底下，但老师依然很投入地在讲，辛苦了！

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
He's the Mr. Rogers of linear algebra.

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
What's nice is YouTube allows you to change the speed...the lecture goes much faster and still very clear to understand this brilliant professor.

### Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wait, did he ever account for vector N not being a unit vector? He never required that the N vector represented the area of the delta slanted plane did he?

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If s/t is velocity what does ds/dt mean?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Great

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
The last example was really neat.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yes if I do it on a t

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
what Went wrong with lec 4 ?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
That's too much !!

### 3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I
Real great explanation

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
i got so invested in the lecture i was replying whenever he asked the class a question

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
thank you mit for this

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
It's interesting that he constantly regards on the fact that he exposes things without proving them, but in fact I think he explains the things so clearly an understandable that he does'nt need to prove them, because we can realize about them almost in an axiomatic way.

### 7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars
I am reading his book for several months now. Didn't know he also have videos. It feels like listening to a living legend. I am happy :)

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Good day. Is there a certain textbook recommending?

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]It's easy : 5*45X^4+144+3000X^2-8X

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Was there an inconsistency in what he did at 34:33 and 34:37, he pointed to different lines? It seemed intentional, can anyone explain why he multiplied by a number on the "y=g(X)-axis" and then a number on the "x-axis" when everything maps to the same number on the y-axis?

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very nice

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
Let's make Matrix Orthonormal Again!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Nikola Tesla could solve calculus equations in his head. Why don't we all just do it like Tesla?? 

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
At t = 38:00, Strang shows a way that expedites finding L:  find E, then solve [E| I | to get E inverse which = L. Now we can quickly decompose A into LU if we do Gaussian elimination only--not Gauss-Jordan elimination--from the beginning. 
At t = 43:00, he defines a vector space out of 3x3 matrices, call it M_33.
At t = 47:00, he covers the dimensions of subspaces of M.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Really,  we should say thanks to you, from the bottom of the heart.

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
43:55 Who else calculated the area while the professor is erasing the board?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Can’t I also choose other values for x2 and x4 to find other particular solutions? Would they not also shift the null space to another spot and cover regions which were not already defined? Or does the particular solution + null space contain the set of all possible solutions for Rx=b?

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Dr. Strang: in the example where you draw that plane in 3space does that plane contain the origin?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I think another title for this course could be.

If we knew everything, we wouldn't need statisticians. But we don't know shit, so statisticians rule the world.

Haha 😂 (no offense to statisticians! It's interesting stuff!)

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
you don't see many youtube videos with 100k plus views in 7 years with 0 dislikes

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Where are the next lectures for A^TA ???

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
This is SO helpful, more than thankful for this upload. I really like this professor too.

### 34. Final Course Review
God Bless professor Strang! :)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
 lol ! I am sorry but "chalk board at MIT" in this day and age of "advanced computer screens and computer technologies??? lol ! Educational tools should all be digitized and less time spent "writing aggressively on chalk board" ! lol..Just a bad way to each lots of supposedly smart students ! :)))

### 35. Finding Clusters in Graphs
The courses taught by professor Gilbert is just aaaawesome!!!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
Ooooooooooooooooh my god this is soooooo beautiful. Thank you.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you very much, prof Strang.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]First year calc is usually review of high school math. I wouldn't be surprised if you understand these concepts already.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Every student should have at least one professor like Prof Strang. Motivating, illuminating and such great energy. I truly appreciate these classes. Thank you!

### 3. Independence
I am lost with calculation for last question at 29:46 ... Probability of 11th toss being H, given that first 10 tosses are heads.. If I compute using conditional probability, it comes to be same as Probability of 11th toss being H (without any condition, previous question)

x1/y1 events when first coin is picked
x1 => 11th toss is H
y1 => first 10 tosses are heads
P(x1|y1) = P(x1 intersect y1)/P(y1)

Assuming first coin => P(x1 intersect y1) => probability that first 11 tosses are H => (0.9)^11
P(x1) = (0.9)^10 
Thus , P(x1|y1) = 0.9.. and multiple by 1/2 since we picked first coin.

on similar grounds P(x2|y2) = 0.1 * 1/2

final is 0.9*1/2 + 0.1*1/2 => 1/2   , which is same answer as previous question.. I might be missing something very basic.. please correct me if I am mistaken in my computation

Thanks for reviewing Matrix.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
It hurts so indefinitely much that I see him getting old ,
He is the most beloved teacher that I ever had.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I love Prof. Gilbert's lecture videos on Linear Algebra. I read his books and watched his videos five years back, but I enjoy it watching him again.

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
@[USERNAME]I'm not exactly sure what portion of the lecture you're referring to, but if you're talking about the later 3/4, I think he means that A imparts transforms upon the vectors that are expressed with the basis {v1, v2,...,vn} and transforms them into a new basis {w1, w2,..wn} where T(v1), T(v2), etc. are all functions used to express the original bases {v1, v2, etc.} "in terms of" {w1, w2, etc.}  So the system of equations is just a generalization of that concept.

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
what would be a sub space if the two columns of the r3 are same.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
37:04 But what's going on !!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces

Professor Strang is an iconic figure in Linear Algebra, but in this video, he uses notation that violates one of my pet peaves:  R^3 for the space of (3x1) matrices with all real entries.  The trouble is that in essentially every linear algebra text at this level, the early introductory material includes very strong admonitions to students that they MUST NOT say that a matrix A is equal to a matrix B when B does not have exactly the same number of rows as A.  (To be continued...)

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
This lecture on factorization is very helpful ,however   I don't fully understand why this concept. is important.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The guy one The first bench looks like kanye west from back

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
@[USERNAME]oh, right, I used to do that. You tend to forget about these things quickly ;)

### 24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
Brilliant ! A masterpiece from a French man !

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
MIT professors teach like their students have no background knowledges, and my professors assume I have learnt all shit already in High school

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
its amazing that he can do the lesson in a fun and creative way with real problems and great humor..awesome lecture again

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You must be a star

### Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I love Prof. Jerison, but sometimes I feel he over-complicates stuff which ends up confusing me

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
The legend....

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
In short, A^T*A is invertible if and only if A is full column rank!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
This lecture is amazing! This is the deepest understanding of linear regression one could get.
Thanks MIT for sharing it with the world ❤️

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
much better than my prof ! I like him

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
who was mean enough to click "dislike"?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
We study this at just 12 years of age in India. This is very simple maths, why do you Americans need to attend MIT for such basic maths? Please look at India as it has a better education system than America.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Remember I saw prof. Strangs other linear course many years ago. So unbelievable good lecturer he is!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces

...SPORTS. IT'S IN THE GAME!

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Very good video. Amazing what mathematics can do.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
but what why doesn't matrix multiplication works as matrix. addtion. ?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
I couldn't find assignment 1 in the website the 30 problem I founded assignment 4 in the place of 1 help please thanks in advance

### 25. Classical Inference III
Thank MIT and Professor for your course!

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
guys at the end of the video, why isn't  b(transpose) * q1 = 0, like a(transpose)*q2 is 0  ?

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
24:00 what does the capital after the transition function stand for? new variable for states (Q)? And is it the same variable as 54:00?

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
X²+y²+z²1 is the equation of the unit sphere

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Satellite preferably above the earth.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
MIT cheap board !!!!!   LOL

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I don't understand why MIT can only afford a minimum waged camera man to shoot this video, pathetic !!!

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This teacher is excellent because you are able to follow along with the gears that are turning in his head.  He actually reasons with you.  I remember that the linear algebra teacher I had was hopeless and would merely bark canned lectures at you without a thought.  Yeah, that guy wasn't a man of reason but a weight lifter, ex wood worker, simply there for a pay check.

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
This dude sucks

### 16. Markov Chains I
very well explained!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Please record your introductry number theory lectures

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
At 21:30, when Strang is performing the linear transformation of the unit circle, shouldn't the image be rotated 90 degrees. 

It seems like the x stretching is by a factor of 2 and the y stretching by a factor of 3. But he did it the opposite way. 

I am but a humble pupil looking to understand and correct any bugs in my intuition.

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions

Oh, how I wish my LA prof had been this good!  Prof Strang is indeed a highly skilled teacher.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]poor ignorant.

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank You MIT OCW. Thank you Prof. Strang.

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I think the derivative of U(x)V(x) ,we should add and substract u(x+deltax).v(x) instead of u(x) ..... 

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'll certainly come back to revisit, I wish I had seen the series during my undergrads. Anyway, great course, thanks to MIT!

### Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory
In the theory of ordinary differential equations, spectral methods on a suitable Hilbert space are used to study the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of differential equations.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wonder how they could understand all of that in 47 min !??

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Gauss given order :D

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
18:13 to review the meaning of span

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I lost at 31:53. Somebody help...

### 10. Continuous Bayes' Rule; Derived Distributions
Thanku

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
The complexity of matrix multiplication is of the order O(n^3), that's fine. But in every step in the we are changing just one row...therefore, shouldn't the cost be n+ (n-1)+ (n-2) + ........+1, ie O(n^2), if we have a suitable algorithm?

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Thank you

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
lots of help!

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I'm just starting online with Prof Strang's class on youtube..  I love his style, his speed and his passion to inspire thought about the answers.  The man appears to be one of the truly gifted educators and thinkers.  Thanks to MIT for posting this and other knowledge online!

### 4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Excellent lecture  -- very difficult material --- expert presentation.  Suggestion: let the students work out the mathematical manipulations, and emphasize the concepts in the lecture:  Yes, state the theorems, but then present lots of real world examples, such as weather data,  demographic data, economic data, especially cases where the data might be modeled in a variety of ways etc .  The point:  mathematical manipulations are relatively easy once you know the rules, but the ideas are subtle and (probably) can only be grasped/conveyed via examples.  Yes, the lecture had lots of simple examples expertly woven into the theory, but the emphasis was on the mathematical manipulations and not enough on the concepts.  Bottom line: superior lecture in any case.  Two thumbs up!

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
AT we reach 35 minutes of this lecture,
Why they have written -rsin∅? what is x sub theta?

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks so much

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Linear algebra had been mystery for me until I saw these types of lecture online. Thanks

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
linear transformation is defined before matrix

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in india we study all this in standard 10

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
who is this magnificent instructor?! He puts all of my math professors to shame!

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x) and not sin(x)

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
In the first lecture, from 14:10  to 15:26 the dude threw on the gem. If you notice this is the idea of vector spaces something which really you don't understand when you start linear algebra. Moreover, he pushed the argument at 22:00 with all the beauty to show that a column picture is a preferred way of looking when it goes into a higher dimension, the point on which he comes back in vector spaces. Finally, at 28:00 he concludes an important thesis for vector spaces.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm 15 and do this in school

### Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step
Proffesor g.strang is the best.most advanced .mit.he deserves the honors for his intellectual abilities. Thank y2k very much for all your online lectures.i enjoy learning from you very much.thank you.lLSHALM BETTY M.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks, any other 15 year olds watching these lectures, pretty useful for GR actually

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
He is not only a master lecturer, he is a master of writing on a chalkboard. I swear, it looks like he is using a paint pen.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
hmm - after first 2min profesor says: what you'r gonna learn here - is how to read/write a proof about (... - input here any field of interest)
if I would imagine worst introduction to the math course - that would be the one :(

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
24.41, this guy is a legend. I wonder where he is now.

### 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
why at the last example there is no second eigen vectors .. why it can't be equal {-1 , 0 } .. is that because it will be // to it in the other direction .. and there is no one perpendicular to it ??

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
No students...??

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Can someone please explain why property 3b is also true for the volume?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
"in that Gauss given order" ... I'm taking this one to the bag

### 34. Final Course Review
Thank you professor Strang for your excellent work and your outstanding book. It Took me a little bit more than a semester to finish the book and the class and the book but I think it was well worth it. I only wish there was a lecture about Hermitian matrices and Fourier series! You will always be in my heart as the best teacher I ever had.  


Kind Regards,

no quite understand why "a" which is the distance between the curve and the origin, is interpreted as the speed. Also, how to interpret "a" if the origin is not at the centre of the circle.

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
God (although highly unlikely to exist), i hate this man's speech parameters and habits. So i think i beter go and read smth on statistics, rather than cripple my nervous sys.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
May Allah Almighty bless him with health and happiness. He's my spiritual father from my entire graduation level to my Master's. Thank you so much Sir for everything. Love you.😍🥰🥰 #Pakistan

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
Professor Strang's lectures taught me a lot. Thanks professor and MIT OCW.

### 14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility
Don't understand why (a) is not a solution for check-in 14.1.

Consider the NTM which decides whether <G,s,t> \in HAMPATH or not.

NTM *decides* this in poly(m) time, where m = size of input (say, the number of vertices).

Thus, NTM is able to accept or reject input in poly (m). 

Since it is also able to reject in poly(m) time, why can't you invert the solution? 

Or am I wrong in believing that it can also reject in poly(m) time?

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
Why didn´t I see this videos in the university?

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
Thank you! :)

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Watched 18.065 right after 18.060, finally finished both playlists now, thank you MIT and Prof. Strang for this two informative and engaging courses!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
41:00 I was thinking this is like RegEx and then I was like hey this IS RegEx .. Fun to learn TOC at a random point in my education

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
0 probability can mean impossible because you will never be able to measure with infinite precision, so you never can tell for sure that you hit a certain point.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
"I shouldn't do this, but I will"

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Well, it's a good thing I'm taking this in grade 11 (voice dripping with sarcasm). 

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
At 44:31 why did sir say solving 3 equation by 2 variables is not possible. We have seen in our schools that the number of variable should be equal to number of equation in order to evaluate the variable. Plz explain.

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
MIT is doing affirmative action?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So glad I never have to do this stuff again😵  Would have been great, though, having this available way back when.  Remember having a YA who spoke ZERO English.  You had to get up with your book and go to the front and point out the problem to him😬

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces

25:11 amazing

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
I go to texas tech university and amidst covid 19 I have been having a hard time with linear algebra help, this was a nice relief. My question is transforming the basis of numbers I completely get and I want to know if this applies to unit conversion with physical properties.  Like in doing stochiometry to convert between units (same plane). Or the relationships we get from integration and derivation like mass and force. Thank you for this resoucre incredibly helpful

### 34. Final Course Review
thanks

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]cool story brah

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
great video. A discussion woth my dad about him failing real analysis is what played the seed of being a math major. We had that conversation probably 6-7 years ago and now i’m a junior in college pursuing a math degree. So happy to have this information at my fingertips. I get to watch these lectures in my own time and learn a lot by myself

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
NO CHILL GIL

### Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
6:34, how is that z=z0 + dz/dx(x-x0) a equation of straight line. y=mx+c is a eqaution of straight line in 2D space. and x = x0 + st is vector form of equaiton in higher dimension. how is  the above euqation realted to this? Thanks in advance

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
May God bless this teacher.These are those kind of people that makes you to love learning anything even if that thing might be boring.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
GREAT PROFESSOR

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
plug and substitute I finally recon that teacher like to talk and write a lot, you have already made the Pascal triangle in ! combinatory arithmetic, now after calling some algebraic Newton parabols and keep on playing with some curves aproximations like a baby nursing around sins and cos return to the exponential functions,differential, derivatives integrals exponents vectors determinants matrix, how about using some computers and projectors  for your classes This is worst than the stone age.

### Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why does the method for Ex 3 have dtheta, it makes sense to me when you find the integral wrt dx you multiply the function by dx to form a series of rectangles, but why are we multiplying the height given by sintheta by the angle?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
Conclusion: 1. To calculate Ax=0 in other words calculate the null space of A, we can use 'reduce row echelon form'  (rref) method.
2. The rank of A equal to the number of pivots or rows after reducing row echelon, notation as r.
The column of A equal to the number of variables, notation as n.
So n-r is equal to the number of free variables.
3. Consider the solution of Ax=0, if we calculate the reduced row echelon form of A consisting of [T F], the solution matrix will be the transform of [-F T], where T stands for identity matrix and F stands for free matrix.
The solution matrix would be n*(n-r) shape.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
14:15

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Wonderfully explained - matrix, linear combination, vector, basis, etc.  Sc kani

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Where the fuck is part two?!

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
This is so beautiful!

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
This time he is wearing the same green shirt that he wore in the previous lesson as opposed to the red shirt he wore in the first lesson.
 
*stares blankly into space*

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Every time I see one of Professor Strang’s lectures I run and get my old Finite Math with Calculus book just to see how much I’ve forgotten 😉 He’s awesome to listen too🙏

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
ln|x+1|+3ln|x+2|+C.    2:21

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I wonder why these kids are so unresponsive and dumb, I'd jump to answer such a brilliant teacher. This man made me fall in love with math!

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I like this class!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
how did he get the numbers for the matrix at 9:35?

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
Wow!! Thanks very much MIT!! Really appreciate the amazing sharing of resources and hopefully one day we will get open courses on the key undergraduate and graduate math subjects!

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
no no no sir, thank you

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
he's so cuteeee

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
and its exactly the golden ratio..

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you MIT. I'm a chemical engineer with over 3 years experience in the industry. Just recently I needed to go back and relearn basis of calculus. This was a great refresher

### 14. Poisson Process I
what is the reason behind considering second order terms of delta? since it is just an interval.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
In two years of junior college and 4 years of engineering, not once did anyone gave the column picture explanation. Mind blown. Thank you, Dr. Strang.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Thanks! Thanks! XD

### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
fuckin conservatives, they just go round in circles and do nothing as a result

### 18. Properties of Determinants
very informative, thanks.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you Prof Aureux.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
lecturer keeps on saying - "what is this good for" and i cannot for the life of me concentrate due to my inner monologue sounding like chris rock and singing - "absolutely nothing!"

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
There is a difference of concepts between Lec1 and Lec2. Does anyone else feel the difference

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
👏👏👏congratulations from Brazil for the class !

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
okkkkk, cameras are rolling, this is lecture 14. What an intro line!

### Lec 25 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
He should have been awarded with some applause at the end :)

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]correct me if I'm wrong, the function is symmetric across the origin, not across the left and right side as professor Jerison perhaps mistakenly said. Meaning the 1st and 3rd quadrant are symmetric, and the 2nd and 4th quadrant are symmetric.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Thank you professor Tsitsiklis, It is clear and simple.

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
Is Linear Algebra useless? How would you go about solving a million equations with a million unknowns?

### 3. Parametric Inference
Why is the volume so low on this video?  I'm pumped up to full and I can barely hear him.

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
calls the first row a 'HE'
the second row a 'SHE'
18:35

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
I took linear algebra 30 years ago and I thought it was pretty hard at the time.  Prof. Strang makes it easy!

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Please can any one let me know which grade syllabus is this one?  Is it Bachelor class?

### 34. Distance Matrices, Procrustes Problem
DR. Strang , thank you for another strong explanation of Distance Matrices and also the failure of the Triangle Inequality in Numerical Linear Algebra. Defining and explaining the Trace is another important part of Numerical linear Algebra.

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
This lecture in specific was truly beautiful

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]i also forgot to mention that you can also type in the name of the college eg. harvard, cambridge, StanfordUniversity, UCBerkeley, nptelhrd, calcommunitycontent etc

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
Thank you, sir Strang!

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I wish I knew or cared for the meaning of life for you.

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Is the ((A transpose) * A ) always invertible?

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
Even a high school student can understand his lectures.

### 4. Factorization into A = LU
how do we get 24 p's for the 4x4 
i think i got lost 😅

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
The absolute lack of rigor and the hand-waviness of the lesson makes this video a popular science segment rather than a math lesson.  A nice popular science segment, but I certainly hope MIT students of Physics and engineers are directed to take something with a higher level, significantly so.  Physics undergrads don't need total rigor, but such a total lack of it doesn't develop mathematical thinking.

### 14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse
"Be... and be new..." Sounds like a philosophical statement 🧐

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
The way the ideas were tied together in the end - simply beautiful.

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
that's just great, the proof removed so many misconceptions!
thanks Philippe Rigollet

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
i am his virtual student and i am proud of it...in lecture 8 of linear algebra, while writing the summary , he feels something went wrong and the moment he find out he grab his head like a child and said " not, oh my god" and correct the error. this shows that he actually get involved with students while doing maths on the board... the ego of being a instructor is missing in this great personality.. we can learn how to teach from him side by side of the mathematics.

jeeeesssssuuuusssss .... have to watch this video in 2x speed. he talks soooo slowly

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
44:50 : why a11 a21 ... am1 is the first column of matrix A? 
Isn't this equation right? >> T(V1) = AV1 = a11w1 + a21w2 + ... +am1Wm

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
It’s such a conundrum. I feel like I needed a teacher like this in my school, yet the kids that are able to get into mit l, who probably have less need for a guy like this, get him as a teacher. 

I struggled with really bad teachers all college. If I knew about these lectures, I would have used them to learn lecture instead of my useless professors that I could hardly understand.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
i like his accent :D

### 12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values
I think the class starts to get messy from 18:30, with occasional clarity, prof. Strang starts to throw out facts that do not have a clear logical connections. For example, the introduction of upper Hessenberg, tri-diagonal and bi-diagonal, why we look for them and in what way do they help QR methods are not very natural to me.

### Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
So Kepler could've done all of newtons work. Nice explanation

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
What is the formula from the notes 3B for integrals of that kind?!

### Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
16:30 He says that the function "depend only on one direction of things". I guess he ment it only depends on one of the variables. However, when 4ac-b^2=0, we are still left with the square on the left side, which contains both x and y. Can someone explain what i'm not seeing?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Could i see (A^t)(A) as a dot product of two vectors in the matrix space? 

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
c_i,j =Sum (a_i,t b_t,j)    gives the product of matrices. What happens when we put a (definite) integral in place of the sum? Do we get a product of differential manifolds? Putting surfaces?

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Hello guys , i am going to be taking a class in probability and statistics this coming semester , if anyone has followed these videos , do they cover statics as well or they are biased on probability and they touch both subjects well

Do you recommend any book to read about the GLM, especially on the Hypotheses testing part which is not covered in the course ? thank you

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
That differential equation analogy was impeccable

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Can someone help me? I don't have a good foundation for the details in math atm. I get the concepts really well, but I found something that doesn't make sense to me. When he is doing S (1-cos^2x)*sinx*cos^2x*dx = .... he adds the powers of cos^2x 's and makes it cos^4x. I tried pluging in numbers to see if this logic actually added up and it doesn't unless the base of the number with powers is 1. Is this because cos is considered 1 in some way? If I did 10^2 and 10^2... I get 10^4. lets say my formula is (1-10^2)*2*(10^2)*4=. well (1-100)*2*100*4 = -99*2*100*4 = -79200. But if I add those powers like so... (1-10^4)*2*4=-79,992. Doesn't add up. Anyone??? lol asking for a friend who knows what they are doing. I'm gonna go to school for this stuff but need to know what went wrong here. BTW as I said when the bases of the number with power being added are 1 it seems to work out.

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
So? 

This can mean a lot of things, and one of them is that they couldn´t tape this class and Strang had to repeat it in front of the cameras and they didn´t pay to some people to just sit right there so people like you would stop commenting that fact.

Great classes, I do not speak english as native language, but certainly this is awesome, I really appreciate it

So much Thanks to MIT and Professor Strang!!

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
For those who haven't gone through the lecture....I would say it is the best way this subject can be taught and he explains it very clearly. Not for those who have exam tomorrow.

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
amazing teaching methodology...salute sir!:)

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
In the Fib example, it seems impossible to find a c1 and c2 s.t. c1*x1 + c2*x2 = [1 0]

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
* I can solve Ax=b for all b that is in the column space of A.
* Nullspace is all the vectors x that solve Ax=b where b=0

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n

### 14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility
*There is no video for Lecture 13 as that was the day for the Midterm Exam.*

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you so much for the amazing lectures.. MIT!

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
so what ?


### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
why dimension of {0} is 0 ? I think it could be 1. Because there is a vector [0]. You can multiply it by c, it still keep answer to be zero. 
Any explain ?

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
31:59 Basically, the reason why you can solve this problem, you can make a finite automaton which recognizes the language B, is because that finite automaton is going to keep track of the parity of the number of 1's
it's seen before. This has two states, one of them remembering that it's seen an odd number of 1's so far,
the other one remembering it's seen an even number of 1's before. And that's going to be typical for these automata,
finite automata. There's going to be several different possibilities that you may have to keep track of as you're reading the input, and there's going to be a state associated with each one of those possibilities. So if you're designing an automaton, you have to think about-- as you're processing the input-- what things you have to keep track of. And you're going to make a state for each one of those possibilities

41:52 Show finite automata equivalent to Regular Expression.

Does anyone else feel a nice smooth buttery feeling when the chalk glides against the board?


### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
this is so elementary to be taught on 1st year UNIVERSITY ﻿, but it's well taught GREAT 

### 34. Final Course Review
Thanks to MIT OCW and Prof. Strang from India. This journey of 34 lectures was really amazing !!

### 2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)
how did it go from intro 1 to this? When did he tal about central klimit theorem etc? is he solving exercises? wtf

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Why is the volume low af

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
Is the camera-man sleeping?

### Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory
A child of five years cannot understand this, the wonderful of language is that you can explain anything even child can sense, I think this the old system of teaching mathematics

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is this calculus 4?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Too much suspense! I'm starting the next video now

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
10:14 I don't think the centre of mass of the (N+1)th block would be 1 unit away, unless being considered at infinity.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Apparently you can 
Not only calculate the transformation coordinate of two vectors by just doing dot product between the two vectors..
But you can also calculate the area and volume..
using determinant

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
this is why MIT is world-leading, amazing stuff 
 

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This shit is so good

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
somethings wrong in the last A=QR?  should the transpose on the q_1 q_2 not on the a_1 a_2??????

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I love him with my whole heart.

### Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
That guy who asked 'Are we supposed to understand this' just stopped my brain from going under stress, feeling that why ain't i understanding anything

### 21. Generalized Linear Models
awsome lecture, the content just flows into the mind without much effort!

### Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The guy whit the camera was eating donnuts because he forgets to follow the teacher many times :/

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Great lecture!!
Thank you Prof. Strang!

### 15. Poisson Process II
16:16 I guess it should be P(0,2)*int_0^3 f_T1(t)dt (probability of catching 0 fish in 2 hours*the probability of the 1st arrival within 3 hours). Then I get the same results
but somehow if you use P(0,2)*(1-P(0,3)) it's also the same result

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Probably not the best instructor. There are a lot of instructors on YouTube who are much much better teachers than him. Imagine the students at MIT have to through this .

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]lol econ

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
booooooo

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Ok Universities: teaches L'Hospital's Rule immediately after differentiation as a way of solving limits.
MIT: teaches L'Hospital's Rule last.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Great lecturer, mediocre author.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

### 24. Classical Inference II
why should E[X] be zero at 21:30? I understand that W can be assumed with mean 0 but why X?

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
It would be great if "man" and "mankind" were just "humans" and "humankind". It's a super easy change.

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
미안하다 이거 보여주려고 어그로끌었다.. 선대 수준 ㄹㅇ실화냐? 진짜 세계관최강자들의 싸움이다.. 그 찐따같던 대수학이 맞나? 진짜 선대는 전설이다..진짜옛날에 맨날 선대와 군 봤는데 진짜 내가 다 감격스럽고 null space부터 eigenvector까지 가슴 울리는 장면들이 뇌리에 스치면서 가슴이 웅장해진다.. 그리고 강의에 진짜 언제 이렇게 신급 최강들이 되었을까 옛날생각나고 나 영재고 준비할 때 생각나고 뭔가 슬프기도하고 좋기도 하고 감격도 하고 여러가지 감정이 복잡하네.. 아무튼 길버트는 진짜 강의 중 최강명작임..

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
After passing  the linear algebra course, i was kind of disappointed no need  to see your lecture   again . but for data analysis u came again in a HD resolution. So glad to see you professor .

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I don't know, why some people unlike this kind of valuable lectures....?

### Lec 24 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
🖕🖕🖕probability🖕🖕🖕

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
I'm confused about the intersection of sub spaces. 
1) If the intersection doesn't contain the origin then you can't multiply by zero and hence doesn't satisfy condition 2
2) v&w may be in both sub spaces and can be added or scalar multiplied in either, but once the subspace is constrained, how do you know this is still true?

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
"I see that this fourth space is getting  second class citizen treatment..it doesn't deserve it"

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
All his application lectures seem kind of sloppy

### 15. Regression (cont.)

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule
Thankyou professor

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
It is heart warming to see so many people showing appreciation for this great man. It is has been an honor to watch this man's classes.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
at 38:40 "has anyone seen this before?"  I mean...HOW DID YOU GET INTO    M  I  T    if you don't know what the Law of Cosines is????

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
48:37 A little confusion here. Don't you have to use a lower bound for that junk terms? Big O is an upper bound. And (delta x)^2 cannot be an upperbound for, say, (delta x)^3.

### 8. Undecidability
absolutely loved this lecture. so many elegant ideas! witnessing ⟨D⟩ being fed into D felt as mindblowing as learning the Y-combinator

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Interesting. When I think about the prospect of even the function of a -a^x I don't know how that would even be graphed. Seeing as the fractional powers between the integers would involve roots of negative numbers right? 

Take -2^1/2 for example, which would imply the square root of -2, which is undefined unless we use imaginary, right? 

Thinking about it, I guess you could graph the integer values of x which would generate alternating positive and negative y's right? hmm.

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Think think his proof at 22:38 is unclear. cos(t) is not represented by the green line, rather it is the distance from the center of the circle (or tip or the arc) along the radius to the point where the green line meets the radius line. cos(t) approaches 1 as (t) approaches 0, and hence cos(t) - 1 approaches 0.

### 2. Conditioning and Bayes' Rule

Gilbert sir...You have taught this topic in the best way possible...Thank you

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
(Negative due to that positive direction is chosen upwards; speed is the absolute value |v|, meaning it only cares about the magnitude, not the direction, hence it's a scalar.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I am not surprised ShaneHayes that you are doing this in school. This is the first lesson in AS level differential calculus taught to 16/17 year olds all over the UK. The delivery is complicated but the ideas are identical


### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
we are grateful of MITOCW and prof Gilbert Strang, we might not be at MIT but we have the sense of being there and learning whatever you offer. 
you are doing the best thing a human being can do.

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
i learned this in highschool

### 27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima
Question) If we complete the squares of the eq. (at 44:53), I don't think the squares get multiplied by the three pivots(2, 3/2, 4/3)... Can anyone tell me why?

### 34. Final Course Review
The application of the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra is the constant theme of Professor Strang's lectures:
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofLinearAlgebra.html

I never heard of this theorem before these lectures, and I'm an Old Bastard. So this has been a fun learning experience!

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
I LOVE GILBERT STRANG SIR. I am in high school and love his lectures. All this is taught in a boring way in our class...but STRNG SIR maks this topic epic. Now I love linear algebra!! thanks a lot MIT for helping millions like me

Great! What a gifted Professor, thank you Dr. Strang!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
x+y+3z=5
is the equation of a plane ..
Then you find normal vector from that equation
which is perpendicular to the plane..
So maybe the equation of that normal vector is
x+y+3z=0
Then normal vector to the plane is
N=<1,1,3>
Then do dot product between N and Z
If it is 0 then it is perpendicular to N and thus Z is parallel with the plane x+y+3z=5
People might be mistaken ..
Ah just do dot product between Z and <1,1,3> ..ah it's 0 so it must be perpendicular to the plane x+y+3z=5
And doest not realized <1,1,3> the normal vector of plane x+y+3z=5..
I don't really understand this..
Because what does x+y+3z=0
Represents?
Is it perpendicular to x+y+3z=5?
It must be not true
Because the planes must be parallel to each other because the coefficient of x,y,z are similar
Maybe the way he gets the normal vector is weird but it is what it is

Could someone explain to me why d/dx f(kx) = kf'(kx) around 18:00? 

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
This is Pop mathematics. He did not explain why the derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of the respective derivatives. Given that is correct you assume that the derivative of the product of two functions is the product of the respective derivatives?  Of course not because (f * g)'(x)=f'(x)*g´(x)+f(x)*g'(x),

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]The Khanacademy ones do give you the intuition but the ability to derive them, at least for me, brings this one over the top.

While Mr. Khan is great at giving you intuition, I think it is much better for you to be able to derive the equations in order for you to get the intuition.

Also he doesn't tell you how to derive anything, other than a few instances.(From what I have seen.)

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Teaching like this is exceedingly rare..Gilbert Strang is near unique.

### 5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices
Does he mean "a * a^T" near the end of the video?

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions

### 34. Final Course Review
Well that was quite the pleasure! Thank you Professor Strang for your excellent instruction! I had to rewatch some episodes after getting to the halfway point due to a forced break resulting in me forgetting a few points, so really I've now seen 50+ of these. They were always great, though! And I intend to take the Computational Science and Engineering and Differential Equations and Linear Algebra courses, too. Hope they're equally as good!

Damn, his jokes are just not landing.

### Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Between Auroux erasing chalkboards and Walter Lewin making dotted lines, MIT is full of chalkboard GODS.

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Thanks for this amazing lecture .

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
From a pedagogical point of view this lecture ist bad.

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
I love you professor !!!

### 20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity
I find it sad that more people are watching politicians debate than all this amazing free education.  Wake up people, be smarter.  Anything the government gives you was first stolen, then leveraged with the central banks.  Turn off the 'entertainment' and get smart.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### 20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume
Aha so close to finish course 😏 only twelve lectures remained 🤗

### 30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices
"if you cannot explain what you  learnt to a little child in the way that she/he can understand easily, you definitily didint understood what you a trying to explain". This Professor Understood deepily lenear algebra. Congrates and thanks

### Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
and unacademy says...their content is best...lol

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Guys, remember this is simply revision!

(its a very international university and people know different things so they make sure everyone knows the basics of everything and then they work them hard)

this is to level the playing field, also note that they do this stuff very very quick and so someone who has no experience with them will still struggle (im from the UK btw)

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
I think he made an error. He said the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is 1, but actually it is 1 or -1. Then Det(A) = + or - the product of the singular values.

### Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b
In Dr. Strang's lecture, every idea rolls out so naturally that you feel the world should have been like that in the first place.

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
This man is my hero 🙌🏽✨

### Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
The geometric proof was great.

### 11. Derived Distributions (ctd.); Covariance
thank you so much!

### Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
CLEARLY the camera man DOES NOT attend MIT.

### Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
30:40 that thing won't stop staring at me :O

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]You think it matters? You really don't have to be overly smart to go to a school as great as MIT. You just have to show them you have the persistence to learn from their staff. Obviously, you cannot be overly stupid either.

### Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
while explaining flux in his 2nd question. the force was only directed towards the z- axis ;
the question is if we look physically doesn't it happens that the flux is zero , as the amount of flux entering is also leaving . please explain

### 6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
hello

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I just found this guy.  Man, he is good.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
2:00 hahahaa

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
how many of you here are from iit delhi

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
What is the use of this?

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
good teacher

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
36:21 how can sum(x^n) be 1/(1-x), that is obviously too small

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
can anyone provide me notes

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs
I did not have 1 degree of separation from that woman.

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
could someone explain how to do the integral at 28:00?

### 7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A
It seems that Prof. Gilbert Strang is a fan of Gauss.

### 8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)
why can we treat the mean of x equal to 0?

so sweet... i wish my linear algebra prof was actually interested in teaching math

### Lec 26: Spherical coordinates; surface area | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mr. Denis made me able to pass my final Multivariable Calculus exam... He's the boss!!!

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
carai mindblowing essa parada de infinitesimais

### 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
32:41 – that's where the FFT part starts.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
The best math professor I have ever enxountered

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
For people who are confused, try studying basics of 3-D geometry. You will easily understand the equation of tangent plane. It is basically asking us to find the equation of a plane whose direction ratios of its normal vector and the a point through which it passes is given.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Hot off the presses : We can pair every positive floating point number 
using up only about 20% of the integers 

Algorithm #1 : Convert a float with a zero whole part into an integer

1. Reverse the character sequence representing this float
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example :  Convert the float 0.002743 into its integer equivalent
1. Reverse the float string to obtain 347200.0
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the integer 3472000 
3. Note : All corresponding integers will be terminated by the character  “0”

Algorithm #2 : Convert a float with a non-zero whole part into an integer

1. Count the number of whole digits or NWD (those preceding the decimal point ) 
2. Append a number of  “0” digits equal to NWD to the float. 
3. Append a digit “1”  to the resulting float
4. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example : Convert the float  1230.0098 into its integer equivalent 
1. Count the number of whole digits : NWD = 4
2. Append NWD = 4  “0” digits to obtain 1230.00980000
3. Append a digit “1”  to obtain 1230.009800001
4. Remove the decimal point : this gives us the final integer of 1230009800001

Note : We append a digit “1”  to distinguish the integers derived from floats with 
non-zero whole parts from integers generated by floats with zero whole parts .

This can be done for every  float [whole.fraction]  where whole  >  0  !!! AMAZING!!! 
We just came up with a scheme which pairs each positive float with a positive integer.

Reverse Algorithms : Converting valid syntax integers into floats also exist

### Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You know, up till now, I had considered this guy to be a "definitely good" teacher, but not much past that...   but under the staggering weight of the sheer amount of unforced, helpful insight he provides in this video, I am forced to reclassify him as one of the best math teachers I've seen. If you are reading this, Prof. Jerison - Thank You, Good Sir. Much obliged. */tips hat*

### 20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)
Thank you soooo much!! ❤️

### 31. Change of Basis; Image Compression
He never taught the compression step right? ie., c -> c(hat)

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If the Angle language is German, both Newton and Leibniz were German, which is great for the German people. It means they can solve their own problems on their own land.

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Why you always add y' at the end of differentiation of any y?
Please Answer!!

### 17. Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt
2020 still there, following every tape and note so far,

### Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07
blackboard duster action highlights - 28:28 and 43:30

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
49:35 Why is F1 equal to 1? Isn't the first number in the sequence 0?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Great videos! the only thing that i'm missing is "to rise my hand and ask him some questions"..

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for the lesson! One thing Idont understand is why exactly does the way we do example to with the greater than one same linear factor in the denominator work? I still dont understand how it was roved to be so from the analogy...Please help. Thanks!

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
love this course

### Lec 15 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
36:24 there’s a mistake here. It should lead to integrating [u^(-1/2)]/2

### 4. Counting
What a lecture

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
18:31 26:42 oh lololol :D

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I had 3 semesters math in informatics study. This guy is way better than my prof years ago. He explains it way better

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]Denis Auroux

### Lec 18 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Of all the lectures in this course, this was the least understood. Formulae outta nowhere!!!

### 12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices
Subgraph can be a loop or cant be without a loop. Did this answer ur question?

### 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
thank a lot

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
He talks about 'a bunch of' this and that. Euler would not have talked in such a loose way.

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]This is not how things work. MIT works like a corporation, and when corporations start new projects, they either allocate money for their development from a bank account or by loans. After the project is developed is must be self-sustained and cannot exist as a burden of other projects. Plus, departments compete within an corporation for funding; it's not free for all.

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
@[USERNAME]do you know about Taylor series or Bernoulli's-L'Hopital's rule? This is only the first lecture. The first several lectures (for example math) in technical universities all over the world is repeat of last school lessons. 23 people is schoolie like you, imho.

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007

Liked that teacher! he is funny ^^
great class \o

### 11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs

i really had to stretch my mind here !

Finally the subtitles are on sync!!
This is great!!

### 29. Singular Value Decomposition
"Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra" ~ Wolfram
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofLinearAlgebra.html

Application of this theorem is the underlying theme of these lectures.

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
views has been decreasing since lecture 1 ... only the few remain xD

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I thought Multivariable Calculus was Calculus 3?

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
Fortunate are those who get to study the book directly from the author...

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Very helpful to future students! Great work! Thank you!

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
오늘 지수함수 미분 공부했는데... 추천 동영상에 뜨다니 소오름....

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Is it possible to obtain a course completion certificate in exchange for a final exam to determine the student's level?

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks professor Jerison. Great job
Thanks a lot!

### 10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces
Why does the nullspace of A is in Rn instead of Rm when the special solution vectors have m components

### Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
in pset 7 of 18.02sc excercise 3c-3 the formula used  for the solution is without squaring the distance. I think it's wrong at least I'm missing something with respect at min. 41:00 explanation. Pset (solutions) link: http://goo.gl/Qwyivj

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Please add subtitles in Turkish. Thank you.

### Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thank you,  my university professor did not explain this good. This is called Taylor eqation? Am I right?

### 22. Diagonalization and Powers of A
Clearly Prof.Strang is a master, and his lectures are brilliant. But how do the students learn without Q&A? Is this standard procedure at MIT?

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
At 6:30 , if 3 times 2 equals 6 and 6 minus 8 is - 2 why he wrote positive 2? What did I miss here?

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
why does the chalk on the board have cel shading with edge detection? :o

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i like math series in ocw mit veryy much <3


### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
I never really got the whole picture thing even until now. Does it give any conceptual meaning beyond the definitions embodied by it? Or it is merely a memory aid to remember the definitions? The definitions embodied are:
For any m by n matrix A - row space and nullspace are orthogonal complements in Rn, column space and left nullspace are orthogonal complements in Rm.

i.e. does it supply meaning to the 4 subspaces the way a graph would supply meaning to a function? From what I see, no... Or am I missing something?

### 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Thank u sir. Hope u read this !!

### Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)
Maybe the cameraman can zoom in more, profs handwriting is a bit small

### Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
could someone help me in finding the difference between (delta y / delta x) and (dy/dx) please? 
it would be a great help you have done to me  🧡

Gilbert Strang,

You are an awsome teacher! Congratulations for the great work done and thanks for the opportunity!

Congratulations to MIT as well.

### Lec 25: Triple integrals in rectangular & cylindrical | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
density in grams per cubic inches???? Weird! He was really in a rush towards the end though...

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Is he taken? I’m in love.

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
Its difficulty is irrelevant. If you have to take it, there is not point wondering whether or not it's easy or hard. While there are different universities, the material will always remain the same.

### Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
hell yeah, hyperbola bitch. btw when kepler found out that reality there was no calculus. smart man, huh?

### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
This is art! Indeed!

### 15. Projections onto Subspaces
Damn, this is a great lecture....  somehow connect to the least square problem by the interpretation of pure linear algebra without using calculus.   what an enlightenment.

### Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
You mean the area under the CURVE of sinx lol 
the hump exactly proper terminology :p    who says that?!

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Good lecture.  Horrible camera control.

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Great thanks Mit OCW, the textbook is also great

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Mr David sir L'hospitat's rule  holds  provided f(a)=g(a)  is correct  also limit must exists  means both left & right limits must exist not only right limit

### Lec 13 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
just amazing, thank you ! professor.

### Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07

### 6. Discrete Random Variables II
These whole series is brilliant.  Excellent job by Prof. Tsitsiklis.  My respect and admiration.

### Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
simple and great

### Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Look before you "elope"?

### 19. Determinant Formulas and Cofactors
It is definitely a pun. So hilarious.

### Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks MIT !

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
What is the overall of the E ? You said that there was two E in these case and I want to know what are those E ?

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Thanks for this amazing video... Am a high schooler seeking to study something extra... I am interested, but can anyone suggest me some material, from which I can practice problems as well?

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
Come to visit us in Berkeley!😊

### Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Anyone can tell me at the first time of the lecture, is the formular of total differential from the definition?

### 18. Properties of Determinants
I love these lectures, but it's really annoying how, in a lot of them, the professor's mic stops working at some point and the subtitles also start to get wonky. Makes it really hard to understand sometimes.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Why ||A||2 = max ||Ax||2/||x||2? Can someone help me explain? :(

### Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax
I think this course could be part of the Micromaster Credential in Statistics & Data Science because it all these lectures are CRITICAL to understand learning-from-data processes.

### Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language
Why not introduce Python or R; or is that reserved for the ML + CS courses? Basically why Julia?

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
"why learn statistics?"
To not be fooled by statisticians.

### Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
6:11
Prof Auroux meets an alien...
"Wow another life form! How fascinating! You must tell me... Do you use the same sign convention for curl??"

### 9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables
lovely experiment

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
What about inverses of non-square matrices?

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
just amazing! I feel a little bit sad because I have no chance to listen this course exactly from him :)

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
34:29~35:13
It is really helpful for me that he explicitly pointed that out.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
https://youtu.be/PnH8HbtFMlk

### 6. Column Space and Nullspace
This teacher is amazing! Not just that he lightened me up with linear algebra but it made me really happy to see there are still people so passionate about their work. I just love it!


### An Interview with Gilbert Strang on Teaching Linear Algebra
I really hope Gil gets the time to do his rework of Linear Algebra, I was looking at his new Intro to LA and I love it so much.
He starts off with so many great axioms, and theories, as to why LA is useful in the purpose.
Also gives how to visualize matrices as vectors.

### 23. Differential Equations and exp(At)
I have a question if someone could answer it; 
right at the end of the lecture where a second order diff. eqn is converted into a 2x2 matrix called A;
while defining the matrix A, shouldn't element A22 be= -k/b since on rearranging the  given eqn and solving for y'  we get y'= - (1/b) *y"/b -  (k/b)* y; so since the coefficient of y is -k/b ; shouldn't this coefficient correspond to element A22 of the 2x2 Matrix A?

### Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series
9:42 omit the step of factoring out (-1)^M is not a good way to deliver knowledge.

### Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent Lectures ! Thank you, Prof. Auroux.

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I like how this is almost like an intro to Taylor series, as it explains the first (and second) terms of it; so whenever the students later see it, they will be more familiar with it and can understand how it can be expanded even further to approximate functions

### 16. Projection Matrices and Least Squares
Really an inspiration to me as how the things add up and come together. Great lecture intense easy to follow / understand   

### Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Wow they start by differentiating e^(arctangent(x))d/d. My community college we start with  xd/dx

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
powerful lecture

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
Thanks sir!

### 13. Quiz 1 Review
could someone tell me at 33:33 how do we get [1000] for particular solution? im so confused. Thank you so much!

### Lec 4: Square systems; equations of planes | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
I'm not saying the Spanish model is the best one, and I'm not saying your model is totally wrong, it has good things, but I think there are better societies almost in any aspect than yours, read for example about countries such as Denmark, Norway etc, I think you'll be pretty surprised.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
I came here just for fun, but end up knowing something new. A new and easy method to multiply matrix. Thank you so much 🥰

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
god i wish my teachers wrote this big

### 31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix
So, the eigenvectors of a circular matrix are roots of unity -> Fourier matrix.  I've used Fourier Transform and DCT in image processing and found it amazing but mysterious: where did it come from?  Now I know.  I also never realized convolution is essentially polynomial multiplication... and circular convolution simply applies a modulus to the powers!  Mind expanding; thanks Prof Strang!

### Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Will the proof of the three consequences (if f'(x)>0, then f is increasing, sort of things) still works when there are some wiggles on the function ? For instance, the picture from geometric proof of MVT at  22:00  shows that f'(c)>0 and f(b)>f(a), but the function is not always increasing in the interval from a to b.

### Course Introduction of 18.065 by Professor Strang
Please mit ocw release a tensor calculus course, with full lectures and exercises, that would be amazing.

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
One of my favorite MIT professor. May Allah Almighty bless with long life.

### Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices
Does anyone know something more concrete about the Srebro results? Have they been verified already? How general are they? 44:54

### Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
the crackling in this video is annoying

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
why these video lectures are not to be downloaded?


### Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007

"I dont think we'd better put that on tape here..." Take care prof.Strang dont get "suicided" LOL

### 7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
We can assign arbitrary values to the Pivot Variables as well, right?

### 25. Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness
excellent :o

### 8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R
Powerful stuff.

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
a new course, we are your students.

### 2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA
It would be even better if there are some practical examples

### 1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions
Professor, Can we consider that Σ*1 is equal to Σ^1

### Lec 22 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
anyone by chance know what the problem with particle clumping the professor was referring to? Thanks in advance!

### Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Yeah, he could have covered the ratio test in just as much time as it took to explain why he wasn't covering the radius of convergence.

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
what is his name

### Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Excellent lectures. I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned more than I had expected.

### Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
wtf.. theres Calc AB at MIT?!

### 1. Introduction to Statistics
Can i have that stellar link here

### Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
im in algebra 1...

### 17. Bayesian Statistics
~21:45 0.52 is zero point five two, not point fifty two.---- basic mathematics.

### 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
No esta subtitulada...me cuesta entenderlo :( :(


### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
it's funny but great job by the teacher because these stuff we are doing them at the 3grade of lyceum in greece but they are not explaining them in so much details. This is awesome work. Thanks for sharing the knowlenge.

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
At 45 min 23 sec,in my perspective,that alone cannot lead to the conclusion that E,your elimination matrix,is the inverse matrix because it can also be the transpose complex conjugate of A!And A can be a unitary matrix.I’m really new in linear algebra,but Im pretty guaranteed that that is not the TRUE way of proving that E is the inverse matrix!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
The camera crew does not understand what is important and which shots to take and later include in the final video... Way too many close-ups. In general, if the Professor is pointing to something on the blackboard and it is not included in the shot, it's a major fail.

### Lec 2: Determinants; cross product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
44:02 The "[unintelligible]" was "Similarly for the others, but the others turn out to be zero"

### 2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem
Slow students.

### Lec 7: Review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
when it comes to what's on the exam, suddenly everyone has questions

### Lec 9 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Watch at 1.5

### Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
I am an engineering student and I have been looking for this for such a long time. Real analysis, functional analysis. I hope in the future there will be complex analysis. This is extremely useful for digital signal processing stuff. One strange thing is that currently all the machine learning stuffs are not design for things that have complex number inside them

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
very good lecture


### Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
i should be giving him my tuition money

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.
I even feel that I would like to cry after watching this lecture. The professor explained the thoughts and techniques of maths so clearly that makes me enjoy it very much. I feel just like watching a movie, but the movie let me understand many complex concepts. 
I also found how important a teacher is! How bad some of my teachers are!

### Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
great series and great lecturer - many thanks Denis and MIT

### 2. Elimination with Matrices.

If you're watching this video then you know how beneficial MIT OCW is! Donate now! It literally took a minute and was so easy and I'm not someone who can be bothered donating to things normally..

But if like me you've ever had trouble learning something at school/uni or needed extra material or just been keen to learn then you may have benefited from all the great lectures + content MIT OCW provides! So give back a little even if it's just a few dollars and share and convince others to give too. :)

If we want humanity to progress then education is key and it's great to see one of the best universities in the world putting up it's resources to benefit everyone! 

Let's keep on learning and growing and making this world a better place as a result :)

The best thing in the first 3 lectures is the new way you look at a matrix multiplication as linear combination of either rows or columns which makes more complicated topics easier to understand.

### 23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)
May I have the link to the entire series, please

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
If only there was a way to back up the video to a previous time and watch it again.
Oh well, maybe that technology will come along one of these days.

I think x=0 does not belong to the domain of f , there is no ln(0).

### Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
I used to think that MIT students were kind of special, so amazingly smart! But I realize that they are just the same any other students at other Universities! Oops...

### 1. Probability Models and Axioms
Amazing lecture, such a great professor!

### 18. Properties of Determinants
@[USERNAME]The chalk's really awesome. Looks thicker than ordinary chalk. It seems a bit like the chalk kids use to paint on the pavement!

Who has ever seen a mathematician have a sense of humor. Who has ever seen a young mathematician be a classic.

### Lec 18: Change of variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
How does Jacobian go with nonlinear transformations? Namely if I have u=g(x,y) v=h(x,y) then will dudv=|J|dxdy be satisfied where J=(dg/dx dg/dy; dh/dx dh/dy) ?  (here d's are actually referring to partial derivatives)

### 5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n
What is the feeling of teaching an empty class?

Thanks MIT

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Hard to follow him because him skipping steps.

### 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
21:12 "the three plains meet in one point and that's the solution". I can't get my head to imagine plains intersecting at a point, they keep drawing lines where they intersect.

### Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
34:52 freudian slip

### Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Seeing this in LOCKDOWN is amazing,...

### 28. Similar Matrices and Jordan Form
Lecturing capability aside, the thing that amazes me most about this man is his entrancing hand-writing! They just don't make em like they used to!

### 33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse
What does he mean "A projection matrix is the identity matrix where it can be and everywhere else it's the zero matrix"  at 19:20?

### 3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices
Every time I listen to one of Dr. Strang’s lectures, I have to crack my Finite Math with Calculus book just to refresh on Gauss’s Theory
